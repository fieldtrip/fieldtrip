% Since the tmpcfg.trl is the same as testdata.sampleinfo, the call to
% ft_redefinetrial is expected to lead to the same data, which it doesn't
% note: the data contains overlapping trials.
% Yet, the overlapping segments of the data are not identical, which should
% have led to an error in ft_fetch_data, which it didn't. This has now been
% fixed in ft_fetch_data, so ft_redefinetrial correctly returns an error
% now, since the discrepancy is detected in ft_fetch_data
