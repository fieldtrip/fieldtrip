% DEPENDENCY ft_read_headshape

% reported bug: some particular fif-mesh files don't contain triangle area
% (use_tri_area) information, causing ft_read_headshape to crash (since it
% assumes this info to be in the file)
%
% the crash can indeed be reproduced with the file supplied. the suggested 
% fix is to check for the presence of the field.
% NOTE: the mesh in the file has an empty usetri field, suggesting that the
% mesh only contains a downsampling of the vertices, without a
% re-triangulation. this may explain the absence of the area information.
