This is the FieldTrip TEST directory. It contains a whole bunch of
m-files that we use during development to test that new functionality
works as expected, but also to test that changes to the code do not
break existing functionality.

The files in this directory are split over multiple categories

-  Files named `test_xxx.m` are automatically executed with the whole test batch
-  Files named `inspect_xxx.m` are not automatically executed, but require manual execution and interaction, such as clicking on a button or inspecting a figure 

More details on the FieldTrip test scripts, how to add to them
and/or how to execute them, and how they are used for releases can
be found on https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/testing/
