This is the FieldTrip TEST directory. It contains a whole bunch of
m-files that we use during development to test that new functionality
works as expected, but also to test that changes to the code do not
break existing functionality.

The files in this directory can be split in multiple categories

-  Files named `test_xxx.m` are automatically executed with the whole test batch
-  Files named `inspect_xxx.m` are not automatically executed, but require manual execution and interaction (e.g. clicking on a button)
-  Files named `failed_xxx.m` are not automatically executed, since they are known to be broken
-  Files named `obsolete_xxx.m` are not automatically executed, since they contain code that is obsolete

More details on the FieldTrip test scripts, how to add to them
and/or how to execute them, and how they are used for releases can
be found on http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/testing/
