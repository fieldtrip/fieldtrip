% The report is that the data looks weird and does not contain any
% negative values. I have not checked with old reading functions, but
% with FieldTrip revision 5913 (just after fixing the related bug 1490)
% the data looks meaningful. The channels have large offsets, some appear
% to have clipped, but there are channels that show a physiological signal
% with electrode drift. So it seems that the problem has disappeared.
