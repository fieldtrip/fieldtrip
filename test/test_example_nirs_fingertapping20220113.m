%% Analyzing NIRS data recorded during unilateral finger- and foot-tapping
%
% This example script demonstrates the analysis of data that is shared by Sujin Bak, Jinwoo Park, Jaeyoung Shin, and Jichai Jeong: _[Open Access fNIRS Dataset for Classification of Unilateral Finger- and Foot-Tapping](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9783755.v2)_.
%
% The following links point to the shared data, to the PDF manuscript that explains the shared data, and to a GitHub repository from one of the authors that contains some example analyses on the data.

%* <https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics8121486>
%* <https://github.com/JaeyoungShin/fNIRS-dataset>
%
% The data includes the concentration changes of oxygenated/reduced hemoglobin âˆ†HbO/HbR, trigger information, and fNIRS channel information. The recordings were done for 30 subjects that were performing a finger- and foot-tapping task.
%
% The data were recorded by a three-wavelength continuous-time multi-channel fNIRS system (LIGHTNIRS, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) consisting of eight light sources (Tx) and eight detectors (Rx). Four each of Tx and Rx were placed around C3 on the left hemisphere, and the rest were placed around C4 on the right hemisphere.
%
% The temporal structure of each trial is
%
%* instruction for 2s
%* fixation cross, this indicates that the task has to be executed, for 10s
%* "stop" for 2s
%* fixation cross indicating rest period, for 15-17 seconds
%
% The total duration of a trial, including the instruction, ranges from 2+10+2+15=29 to 2+10+2+17=31 seconds.

%% Convering the MATLAB structure to a FieldTrip raw data structure
%
% Since the data is not stored on disk in a [dataformat](/faq/dataformat/) that FieldTrip can directly read, we will circumvent the FieldTrip reading functions as outlined in [this frequenly asked question](/faq/how_can_i_import_my_own_dataformat/#circumvent-the-fieldtrip-reading-functions).
%
% We start with constructing a MATLAB data structure according to **[ft_datatype_raw](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/release/utilities/ft_datatype_raw.m)**, as if it were produced by **[ft_preprocessing](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/release/ft_preprocessing.m)**.

%% # Convert the optode montage to a layout for plotting
%
% In FieldTrip we can have a [detailled description](/faq/how_are_electrodes_magnetometers_or_gradiometers_described/#the-definition-of-nirs-sensors) of the NIRS optode placement and how optodes are combined to form channels. However, in this dataset this information is not complete and we cannot make a complete |opto| structure.
%
% This is how far we can get
%
opto = [];
opto.label = nirs.mnt.clab(:);
opto.chanpos = nirs.mnt.pos_3d'; % these are all nan

% But this is not a complete description of the channel and sensor information according to **[ft_dataype_sens](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/release/utilities/ft_datatype_sens.m)**. However, a full sensor definitioon is also not required: the opical densities have already been converted in HbO and HbR prior to sharing, so we only care about channel positions for plotting.
%
% For the plotting of channel level data (see also [this tutorial](/tutorial/plotting/)) we need a 2D layout. That is explained in detail in [this tutorial](/tutorial/layout/). If the |opto| definition had included 2D or 3D channel positions, then we could have used **[ft_prepare_layout](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/release/ft_prepare_layout.m)** but now we will manually construct the layout structure.
%
layout = [];
layout.label = nirs.mnt.clab(:);
layout.pos = [nirs.mnt.x(:) nirs.mnt.y(:)]; % these are all nan
layout.pos = nirs.mnt.box';
layout.width = nirs.mnt.box_sz(1,:)';
layout.height = nirs.mnt.box_sz(2,:)';
layout.outline = {};
layout.mask = {};

% I don't think that the 41st position refers to an actual channel, so let's remove that.
%
layout.pos(41, :) = [];
layout.width(41)  = [];
layout.height(41) = [];

% We can plot the layout using **[ft_plot_layout](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/release/plotting/ft_plot_layout.m)** and inspect it in detail. That is something I have done multiple times, going back and forth in the script to ensure that my interpretation of the |mnt| field matches the data.
%
figure
ft_plot_layout(layout, 'label', true)

%
% This shows four groups, with two groups of oxy channels on the left of the figure (for the left and right hemisphere), and the corresponding deoxy channels on the right of the figure. This matches with the schepatic display in figure 1 of the PDF manuscript, and with the displayed data in figure 3 of the PDF manuscript.
%
% To improve the plotting of topographies, we can also make an outline and mask. The outline comproses extra lines that are added to the figure, often we include a circle (representing the head) with a triangle at the top (representing the nose). The mask comprises a series of polygons that are used in topographic interpolation and masking the interpolated data that is outside the head, but also by masking the interpolated data that is in between the grid on the left and right hemisphere. This will become more clear at the end of this example script.

  % upper right

%% # Parsing the events and segmenting the data in trials

% These numbers are larger than the total number of samples, so they do not directly map onto samples. I started off assuming that the marker time is expressed in milliseconds, but that turned out not to be correct. Therefore I experimented with the following piece of code until I had something that made sense.
%
% This timestamp to sample ratio results in the events being nicely spaced over the whole experiment
%
ratio = 75;

% Note that `1/data.fsample = 0.075`, i.e., with the 13.333 Hz sampling rate each sample happens to be 75 ms. When working with unknown data it is not uncommon to have to deal with a puzzle like this, it reminds me of [Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah).

%% # Segment the continuous data into trials
%
% To segment the data we have to create a so-called "trial definition". This would normally be done using **[ft_definetrial](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/release/ft_definetrials.m)** and using the events that were read from the data on disk (had it been a supported file format). The trial definition specifies the begin and end sample of each trial, and the offset, i.e., how many samples the time defined as t=0 is shifted relative to the data segment. Furthermore, it can contain additional columns with trial specific information, such as condition codes.
%
% The temporal structure of each trial is
%
%* instruction for 2s
%* fixation cross, this indicates that the task has to be executed, for 10s
%* "stop" for 2s
%* fixation cross indicating rest period, for 15-17 seconds
%
% The total duration of a trial, including the instruction, ranges from 2+10+2+15=29 to 2+10+2+17=31 seconds.
%
% We will use the standard FieldTrip |event| structure to make the trials, this is also what **[ft_read_event](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/release/fileio/ft_read_event.m)** returns for supported data formats.

offset = - 2*data_raw.fsample * ones(size(begsample)); % each trial has the same 2 seconds offset

% The begin sample, end sample and offset should be integers:
%
begsample = round(begsample);

%
% Although some of the more noisy channels dominate the figure due to the automatic vertical scaling, if you zoom in and pay attention to |Ch4oxy|, |Ch5oxy|, and |Ch6oxy| over the left hemisphere, and |Ch14oxy| and |Ch16oxy| over the right hemisphere, you can see that the left hemisphere shows more activity during the right fingertapping task (blue) and the right hemisphere shows more activity following the left fingertapping task (red).
%
% This [example script](/example/nirs_layout/) explains in more detail how for a NIRS dataset the oxy and deoxy channels can either be plotted on top of each other (which is spatially consistent with how the data is recorded) or side-by-side. Plotting them side-by-side makes the results easier to interpret, especially if you have multiple responses (like we have here for left, right and foot conditions). For plotting topographic distributions you also have to ensure that your 2D channel layout does not have overlapping channels that have bvery different numbers.
%
%% # Plot the topography of the averaged responses
%
% This step benefits from the layout having an outline and especially a mask, otherwise the interpolation will cause the whole image to be color coded, including the pieces in between the hemispheres and in between the oxy (on the left) and deoxy channels (on the right).

%
%
% From the topographic arrangements it is clear that the left hemisphere responds with an increase in HbO to the right fingertapping task and the right hemisphere to the left fingertapping task; the HbR (on the right side of the figure) shows the opposite pattern. Also interesting is that both left and right hemisphere show a decrease in HbO and an increase in HbR during the tapping of the foot.
