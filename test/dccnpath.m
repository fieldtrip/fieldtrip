function file = dccnpath(filename)

% DCCNPATH updates the full path specificaion to a file for all files
% on DCCN home central storage.
%
% Use as
%  filename = dccnpath(filename)
%
% The function assumes that on a Windows machine the DCCN home network
% drive is mapped to H:. The function basically converts between H:\ and
% /home and uses the appropriate file seperator depending on the operating
% system.
%
% An in-place implementation of this function can be realized with an
% anonymous function like this:
%
% if ispc
%   dccnpath = @(filename) strrep(strrep(filename,'/home','H:'),'/','\');
% else
%   dccnpath = @(filename) strrep(strrep(filename,'H:','/home'),'\','/');
% end
