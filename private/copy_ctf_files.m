function copy_ctf_files(oldname, newname, deleteflag)

% COPY_CTF_FILES copies a CTF dataset with all files and directories to a new CTF
% dataset with another name.
%
% Use as
%   copy_brainvision_files(oldname, newname, deleteflag)
%
% Both the old and new name should refer to the CTF dataset directory, including
% the .ds extension.
%
% The third "deleteflag" argument is optional, it should be a boolean
% that specifies whether the original files should be deleted after
% copying or not (default = false).
%
% See also COPY_BRAINVISION_FILES
