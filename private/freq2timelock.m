function [timelock, cfg] = freq2timelock(cfg, freq)

% FREQ2TIMELOCK  transform the frequency data into something
% on which the timelocked source reconstruction methods can
% perform their trick.
%
% This function also performs frequency and channel selection, using
%   cfg.frequency
%   cfg.channel
%
% After source reconstruction, you should use TIMELOCK2FREQ.
