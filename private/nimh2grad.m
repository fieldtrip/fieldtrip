function [grad] = nimh2grad(hdr)

% NIMH2GRAD constructs a gradiometer definition from the res4 header whish
% is read using the NIMH implementation of ctf_read_res4. The grad
% structure is compatible with FieldTrip and Robert Oostenveld's low-level
% forward and inverse routines.
%
% Use as
%   hdr  = ctf_read_res4(dataset);
%   grad = nimh2grad(hdr;
