function [source] = fixinside(source, opt)

% FIXINSIDE ensures that the region of interest (which is indicated by the
% field "inside") is consistently defined for source structures and volume
% structures. Furthermore, it solves backward compatibility problems.
%
% Use as
%   [source] = fixinside(source, 'logical');
% or
%   [source] = fixinside(source, 'index');
