function [h] = fdr(p, q)

% FDR false discovery rate
%
% Use as
%   h = fdr(p, q)
%
% This implements
%   Genovese CR, Lazar NA, Nichols T.
%   Thresholding of statistical maps in functional neuroimaging using the false discovery rate.
%   Neuroimage. 2002 Apr;15(4):870-8.
%
% There are two types of FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg & Benjamini-Yekutieli), of
% which the second is currently implemented.
