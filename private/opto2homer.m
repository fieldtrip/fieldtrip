function SD = opto2homer(opto)

% OPTO2HOMER constructs a Homer-compatible sensor definition (SD) from a FieldTrip
% opto structure.
%
% See https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/homer2:Homer_Input_Files#NIRS_data_file_format
%
% The Homer SD structure contains the source/detector geometry and has the following fields:
%
% nSrcs    - Number of lasers; scalar variable
% nDets    - Number of detectors; scalar variable
% SrcPos   - Array of probe coordinates of the lasers; dimensions <number of lasers> by 3
% DetPos   - Array of probe coordinates of the detectors; dimensions <number of detectors> by 3
% Lambda   - Wavelengths used for data acquisition; dimensions <number of wavelengths> by 1
% MeasList - List of source/detector/wavelength measurement channels. Itâ€™s an array with dimensions, <number of channels> by 4.The meaning of the 4 columns are as follows:
%   Column 1 index of the source from the SD.SrcPos list.
%   Column 2 index of the detector from the SD.DetPos list.
%   Column 3 is unused right now and contains all ones.
%   Column 4 index of the wavelength from SD.Lambda.
%
% The FieldTrip optode structure is defined in FT_DATATYPE_SENS
