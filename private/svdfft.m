function [x, ut, ori, sin_val] = svdfft(f, n, trltapcnt)

% SVDFFT computes a rotated FFT matrix, using the real part of the
% cross-spectral density matrix. This rotation ensures that the phase
% relationship of the underlying sources does not change, while rotating
% the channels such that the first channel contains the maximal amplitude
% signal.
%
% Use as
%   [x, ut] = svdfft(f, n, trltapcnt);
% where
%   n           number of components (orientations) to keep in the output (e.g. 1 or 3)
%   trltapcnt   vector of length Ntrials with the number of tapers
