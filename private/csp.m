function [W] = csp(C1, C2, m)
% CSP calculates the common spatial pattern (CSP) projection.
%
% Use as:
%   [W] = csp(C1, C2, m)
%
% This function implements the intents of the CSP algorithm described in [1].
% Specifically, CSP finds m spatial projections that maximize the variance (or
% band power) in one condition (described by the [p x p] channel-covariance
% matrix C1), and simultaneously minimizes the variance in the other (C2):
%
%   W C1 W' = D
%
% and
%
%   W (C1 + C2) W' = I,
%
% Where D is a diagonal matrix with decreasing values on it's diagonal, and I
% is the identity matrix of matching shape.
% The resulting [m x p] matrix can be used to project a zero-centered [p x n]
% trial matrix X:
%
%   S = W X.
%
%
% Although the CSP is the de facto standard method for feature extraction for
% motor imagery induced event-related desynchronization, it is not strictly
% necessary [2].
