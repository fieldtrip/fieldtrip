function [ftver, ftpath] = ft_version

% FT_VERSION returns the version and installation directory of FieldTrip
%
% FieldTrip is not released with version numbers as "2.0", "2.1", etc. Instead, we
% have a Subversion (SVN) development version and a daily FTP release version.
%
% The SVN development version is labeled with the revision number like "rXXXXX",
% where XXXX is the revision number.
%
% The daily FTP release version is packaged as a zip file and its version is
% indicated with "YYMMDD" (year, month, day).
%
% Use as
%   ft_version
% to display the latest revision number on screen, or
%   [ftver, ftpath] = ft_version
% to get the version and the installation root directory.
%
