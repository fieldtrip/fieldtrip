function [v,ftpath] = ft_version(cmd)
% FT_VERSION provides functionality for displaying version information on
% the current version of FieldTrip being used, as well us for updating the
% FieldTrip installation.
%
% To understand the different options this function provides, a little bit
% of background knowledge is needed about how FieldTrip deals with
% versions. FieldTrip does not use a fixed release system, but instead
% the 'release' version available from the FTP server is updated daily,
% through an automatic script. This release version is based on the
% development version used internally by the developers, which is updated
% more frequently. Development updates are tracked using Subversion (SVN),
% a system that assigns a revision number to each change to the code. The
% release version of FieldTrip contains a signature file (signature.md5),
% that contains, for each file in the release, the latest revision number
% for that file, along with an MD5 hash of the file's contents. A similar
% signature file is located on the FieldTrip webserver, which is updated
% whenever a developer makes a change to the codebase.
%
% This function uses both the local signature file (dating from whenever
% you downloaded FieldTrip) and the remote signature file (reflecting the
% latest version available--this updates more frequently than the daily FTP
% release) to determine (1) the version of FieldTrip you are using, (2)
% whether you have made local changes to your FieldTrip installation (by
% comparing the actual MD5 hashes of files to the ones stored in your local
% signature file), (3) whether there are new updates available (by
% comparing the local and remote signature files).
%
% Usage:
%   ft_version info             - display the latest revision number
%                                 present in your installation
%   ft_version full             - display full revision information about
%                                 your installation; this includes checking
%                                 for local and/or remote changes
%   ft_version update           - also displays full revision information;
%                                 additionally provides the option of
%                                 downloading new or updated files from the
%                                 code repository
%   [v,ftpath] = ft_version     - also get information about the root of
%                                 your FieldTrip installation

% 'Hidden' options:
%   ft_version signature        - generate a new signature file, without
%                                 revision information about the files
%   ft_version fullsignature    - generate a new signature file, including
%                                 revision information; this can only be
%                                 used when you are using an SVN
%                                 installation of FieldTrip
