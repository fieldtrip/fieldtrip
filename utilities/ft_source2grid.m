function [grid] = ft_source2grid(source)

% FT_SOURCE2GRID removes the fields from a source structure that are
% not necessary to reuse the dipole grid in another source estimation.
%
% Use as
%   [grid] = ft_source2grid(source);
%
% The resulting grid can be used in the configuration of another
% run of FT_SOURCEANALYSIS.
