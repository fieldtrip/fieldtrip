function [x] = ft_struct2double(x, maxdepth)

% FT_STRUCT2DOUBLE converts all single precision numeric data in a structure
% into double precision. It will also convert plain matrices and
% cell-arrays.
%
% Use as
%   x = ft_struct2double(x)
%
% Starting from MATLAB 7.0, you can use single precision data in your
% computations, i.e. you do not have to convert back to double precision.
%
% MATLAB version 6.5 and older only support single precision for storing
% data in memory or on disk, but do not allow computations on single
% precision data. Therefore you should converted your data from single to
% double precision after reading from file.
