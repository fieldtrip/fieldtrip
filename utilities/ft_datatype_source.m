function source = ft_datatype_source(source, varargin)

% FT_DATATYPE_SOURCE describes the FieldTrip MATLAB structure for data that is
% represented at the source level. This is typically obtained with a beamformer of
% minimum-norm source reconstruction using FT_SOURCEANALYSIS.
%
% An example of a source structure obtained after performing DICS (a frequency
% domain beamformer scanning method) is shown here
%
%           pos: [6732x3 double]       positions at which the source activity could have been estimated
%        inside: [1x3415 double]       indices to the positions at which the source activity is actually estimated
%       outside: [1x3317 double]       indices to the positions at which the source activity has not been estimated
%           dim: [xdim ydim zdim]      if the positions can be described as a 3D regular grid, this contains the
%                                       dimensionality of the 3D volume
%     cumtapcnt: [120x1 double]        information about the number of tapers per original trial
%          freq: 6                     the frequency of the oscillations at which the activity is estimated
%        method: 'singletrial'         specifies how the data is represented
%           cfg: [1x1 struct]          the configuration used by the function that generated this data structure
%           pow: [6732x120 double]     the numeric data
%     powdimord: 'pos_rpt'             defines how the numeric data has to be interpreted,
%                                       in this case 6732 dipole positions x 120 observations
%
% Required fields:
%   - pos, dimord
%
% Optional fields:
%   - time, freq, pow, mom, ori, dim, cumtapcnt, channel, other fields with a dimord
%
% Deprecated fields:
%   - method
%
% Obsoleted fields:
%   - xgrid, ygrid, zgrid, transform, latency, frequency
%
% Revision history:
%
% (2011/latest) The source representation should always be irregular, i.e. not
% a 3-D volume, contain a "pos" field and not contain a "transform".
%
% (2010) The source structure should contain a general "dimord" or specific
% dimords for each of the fields. The source reconstruction in the avg and
% trial substructures has been moved to the toplevel.
%
% (2007) The xgrid/ygrid/zgrid fields have been removed, because they are
% redundant.
%
% (2003) The initial version was defined
