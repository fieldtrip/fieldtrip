% FT_DATATYPE_PARCELLATION describes the FieldTrip MATLAB structure for parcellated
% cortex-based data and atlases. A parcellation can either be indexed or probabilistic
% (see below).
%
% A parcellation describes the tissue types for each of the surface elements.
% Parcellations are often, but not always labeled. A parcellatoin can be used to
% estimate the activity from MEG data in a known region of interest. A surface-based
% atlas is basically a very detailled parcellation with an anatomical label for each
% vertex.
%
% An example of a surface based Brodmann parcellation looks like this
%
%              pos: [8192x3]         positions of the vertices forming the cortical sheet
%              tri: [16382x3]        triangles of the cortical sheet
%         coordsys: 'ctf'            the (head) coordinate system in which the vertex positions are expressed
%             unit: 'mm'             the units in which the coordinate system is expressed
%         brodmann: [8192x1 uint8]   values from 1 to N, the value 0 means unknown
%    brodmannlabel: {Nx1 cell}
%
% An alternative representation of this parcellation is
%
%              pos: [8192x3]           positions of the vertices forming the cortical sheet
%              tri: [16382x3]          triangles of the cortical sheet
%         coordsys: 'ctf'              the (head) coordinate system in which the vertex positions are expressed
%             unit: 'mm'               the units in which the coordinate system is expressed
%  Brodmann_Area_1: [8192x1 logical]   binary map representing the voxels belonging to the specific area
%  Brodmann_Area_2: [8192x1 logical]   binary map representing the voxels belonging to the specific area
%  Brodmann_Area_3: [8192x1 logical]   binary map representing the voxels belonging to the specific area
%  ...
%
% The examples above demonstrate that a parcellation can be indexed, i.e. consisting of
% subsequent integer numbers (1, 2, ...) or probabilistic, consisting of real numbers
% ranging from 0 to 1 that represent probabilities between 0% and 100%. An extreme case
% is one where the probability is either 0 or 1, in which case the probability can be
% represented as a binary or logical array.
%
% The only difference to the source data structure is that the parcellation structure
% contains the additional fields xxx and xxxlabel. See FT_DATATYPE_SOURCE for further
% details.
%
% Required fields:
%   - pos
%
% Optional fields:
%   - tri, coordsys, unit
%
% Deprecated fields:
%   - none
%
% Obsoleted fields:
%   - none
%
% Revision history:
% (2012/latest) The initial version was defined in accordance with the representation of
% a voxel-based segmentation.
