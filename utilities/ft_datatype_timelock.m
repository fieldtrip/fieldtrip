function [timelock] = ft_datatype_timelock(timelock, varargin)

% FT_DATATYPE_TIMELOCK describes the FieldTrip MATLAB structure for timelock data
%
% The timelock data structure represents averaged or non-averaged
% event-releted potentials (ERPs, in case of EEG) or ERFs (in case
% of MEG). This data structure is usually generated with the
% FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS or FT_TIMELOCKGRANDAVERAGE function.
%
% An example of a timelock structure containing the ERF for 151 channels
% MEG data is
%
%     dimord: 'chan_time'       defines how the numeric data should be interpreted
%        avg: [151x600 double]  the numeric data (in this example it contains the average values of the activity for 151 channels x 600 timepoints)
%      label: {151x1 cell}      the channel labels (e.g. 'MRC13')
%       time: [1x600 double]    the timepoints in seconds
%        var: [151x600 double]  the variance of the activity for 151 channels x 600 timepoints
%       grad: [1x1 struct]      information about the sensor array (for EEG-data it is called elec)
%        cfg: [1x1 struct]      configuration structure used by the invoking FieldTrip function
%
% Required fields:
%   - label, dimord, time
%
% Optional fields:
%   - avg, var, dof, cov, trial, grad, elec, cfg
%
% Deprecated fields:
%   - <none>
%
% Obsoleted fields:
%   - fsample
%
% Historical fields:
%   - avg, cfg, cov, dimord, dof, dofvec, elec, fsample, grad, label,
% numcovsamples, numsamples, time, trial, var, see bug2513
%
% Revision history:
%
% (2011v2/latest) The description of the sensors has changed, see FT_DATATYPE_SENS
% for further information.
%
% (2011) The field 'fsample' was removed, as it was redundant.
%
% (2003) The initial version was defined.
