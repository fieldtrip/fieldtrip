function [output] = ft_transform_geometry(transform, input)

% FT_TRANSFORM_GEOMETRY applies a homogeneous coordinate transformation to
% a structure with geometric information. These objects include:
%  - volume conductor geometry, consisting of a mesh, a set of meshes, a
%      single sphere, or multiple spheres.
%  - gradiometer of electrode structure containing sensor positions and
%      coil orientations (for MEG).
%  - headshape description containing positions in 3D space.
%  - sourcemodel description containing positions and optional orientations
%      in 3D space.
%
% The units in which the transformation matrix is expressed are assumed to
% be the same units as the units in which the geometric object is
% expressed. Depending on the input object, the homogeneous transformation
% matrix should be limited to a rigid-body translation plus rotation
% (MEG-gradiometer array), or to a rigid-body translation plus rotation
% plus a global rescaling (volume conductor geometry).
%
% Use as
%   output = ft_transform_geometry(transform, input)
