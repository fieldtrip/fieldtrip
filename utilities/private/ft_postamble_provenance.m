% FT_POSTAMBLE_PROVENANCE is a helper script that reports the time and memory that was
% used by the calling function and that stores this information together with user
% name, MATLAB version and other provenance information in the output cfg structure.
% This should be used together with FT_PREAMBLE_PROVENANCE, which records the time and
% memory at the start of the function.
%
% Another aspects of provenance relates to uniquely identifying the input and the
% output data. The code that deals with tracking the information about the input data
% structures is found in ft_preamble_loadvar. The code that deals with tracking the
% information about the output data structures is found in ft_preamble_history.
