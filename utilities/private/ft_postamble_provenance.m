% FT_POSTAMBLE_PROVENANCE is a helper script that reports the time and memory used by
% the calling function and that stores this information together with user name,
% MATLAB version and other provenance information in the output cfg structure. This
% script is to be used together with FT_PREAMBLE_PROVENANCE, which records the time
% and memory at the start of the function.
%
% FieldTrip also attempts to uniquely identify the input and the output data. The
% code that deals with tracking the input data structures is found in
% FT_PREAMBLE_LOADVAR. The code that deals with tracking the information about the
% output data structures is found in FT_POSTAMBLE_HISTORY.
%
% Use as
%   ft_preamble provenance
%   .... regular code goes here ...
%   ft_postamble provenance
