function [H] = quaternion(q)

% QUATERNION returns the homogenous coordinate transformation matrix corresponding to
% a coordinate transformation described by 7 quaternion parameters.
%
% Use as
%   [H] = quaternion(Q)
% where
%   Q       [q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6] vector with parameters
%   H       corresponding homogenous transformation matrix
