function s = getsubfield(s, f)

% GETSUBFIELD returns a field from a structure just like the standard
% GETFIELD function, except that you can also specify nested fields
% using a '.' in the fieldname. The nesting can be arbitrary deep.
%
% Use as
%   f = getsubfield(s, 'fieldname')
% or as
%   f = getsubfield(s, 'fieldname.subfieldname')
%
% See also GETFIELD, ISSUBFIELD, SETSUBFIELD
