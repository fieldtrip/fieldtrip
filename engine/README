This is the FieldTrip ENGINE toolbox. It facilitates distributed computing on
a massive multicore computer without requiring the MATLAB parallel toolbox.
It uses the MATLAB engine interface to start multiple instances of MATLAB and
distributes the work between them.

The goal of this toolbox is to provide you with an easy MATLAB interface to
distribute your jobs in a way compatible with the MATLAB dfeval, feval and
cellfun functions.

The FieldTrip ENGINE toolbox is compatible with the FieldTrip QSUB toolbox,
which allows you to distribute your computations to a distributed Linux cluster.
The QSUB toolbox supports Linux clusters with Torque and other PBS versions,
Sun Grid Engine (SGE), Oracle Grid Engine and with SLURM as the batch queueing
system.

This toolbox has been developed as part of the FieldTrip toolbox, but can be
used separately. See http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org for general details on the
FieldTrip project, http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/engine for specific
details on the engine toolbox or see http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq.
