Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) is a package for the anatomical labeling of 
functional brain mapping experiments. It is an in-house package made by 
Neurofonctional Imaging Group (GIN, UMR6232, CYCERON, Caen ,France), which is 
available to the scientific community as a copyright freeware under the terms of 
the GNU General Public Licence.

I Goal

This project has been initiated in the nineties with the construction of a set 
of rules to be used for the anatomical parcellation of the brain according to 
major sulci and gyri. We applied this set of rules to built an anatomical 
parcellation of the spatially normalized single subject high resolution T1 
volume provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) (Collins et al., 
1998). The MNI single subject main sulci were first delineated and further used 
as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 Anatomical Volumes Of Interest (AVOI) 
in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software 
which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of 
interest were then drawn manually using the same software every 2 mm on the 
axial slices of the high resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were 
reconstructed and assigned a label.
Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated 
anatomical labelling of functional studies are proposed :
1) labelling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates,
2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere 
centered by an extremum,
3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an 
activated cluster.

An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) package (Friston et 
al., 1995) is provided as a freeware to researchers of the neuroimaging 
community. We believe that this tool is an improvement for the macroscopical 
labelling of activated area as compared to labelling assessed using the 
Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are well known. However, this tool 
does not alleviate the need for more sophisticated labelling strategies based on 
anatomical or cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps.

III Distribution

The distribution includes a readme.txt (this file), 4 parcellation definition 
files (the ROI_MNI_V4* files), and 9 program file (*.m files).

III.1 ROI_MNI_V4.img (flat short integer image) and ROI_MNI_V4.hdr (header file in 
ANALYZE-7 format with slight customizations to the header as described in SPM 
help/spm_format.man and in Neurological Orientation (R is R)). Each anatomical region is 
associated a gray level (see III.2). 

Note that aal programs manage the orientation of your own analyze image (see defaults.analyze.flip variable).


III.2 ROI_MNI_V4_list.mat : Matlab format file giving the correspondence between the 
anatomical region name and the gray level information.

(*) Note that the cerebral AVOI definitions are fully described in the paper by 
Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). The cerebellar AVOI 
definitions are based on the cerebellum parcellation proposed by Schmahmann et 
al. (Schmahmann et al., 1999).

IV How to install the software.

Note that aal procedures have been tested only on unix machines.

IV.1 Copy the archive to the chosen location
In this example we choose to install the software directly at the same location 
than the spm distribution (/usr/local/soft/spm8/toolbox)

unix> cp aal_for_spm8.tar.Z /usr/local/soft/spm8/toolbox
unix> cd /usr/local/soft/spm8/toolbox

IV.2 Expand the archive will create an anat_aal_vb1 directory
unix> uncompress aal_for_spm8.tar.Z
unix> tar xvf aal_for_spm8.tar

IV.3 Add this directory to your  matlab path
unix > setenv MATLABPATH ${MATLABPATH}:/usr/local/soft/spm8/toolbox/aal

V How to use the software.

V.1 Do a regular statistical analysis using spm8

V.2 Launch matlab
unix > matlab

V.3 launch aal
>> aal

V.4 Choose a labeling procedure. The 3 choices are explained and documented in 
the Neuroimage paper (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002):

Local maxima labeling
Extended local maxima labeling
Cluster labeling

V.5 Select the desired contrast, mask, probability and extent threshold like in 
the regular spm_result

V.6 For "Extended local maxima labeling" input the local maxima radius of the 
sphere in millimeters (default 10 mm).

V.7 Select the anatomical parcellation database :
In /usr/local/soft/spm8/toolbox/aal
The file ROI_MNI_V4.nii

V.8 Results

V.8.1 Local maxima labeling
For each local maxima :
-coordinates in mm x,y,z
-anatomical label (see below)
-distance in millimeter to this region. If the local maxima is inside a region 
this distance is null (0.00). If the local maxima is outside the parcellation 
the nearest region name is displayed in the previous column and the shortest 
distance from the local maxima to this region is listed (exp : 2.30 mm)
-anatomical label of the local maxima to the second nearest region
-shortest distance of the local maxima to the second nearest region
-anatomical label of the local maxima to the third nearest region
-shortest distance of the local maxima to the third nearest region

V.8.2 Extended local maxima labeling
Each local maxima is supposed to be a 10 mm (if the default is used) spherical 
region. The intersection of this volume and the AVOI is computed and the result 
sorted in a descending order according the percentage of overlap (exp : a result 
of Postcentral_L 100 % indicates that the 10mm radius region surrouding the 
local maxima is fully included in the Postcentral_L region)
For each local maxima :
-coordinates in mm x,y,z
-list of anatomical label and percentage of overlap. Percentage less than 1% are 
not listed. If part of the region is outside the parcellation the anatomical 
label will list "OUTSIDE".

V.8.3 Cluster labeling
The intersection of each cluster and the AVOI is computed and the result sorted 
in a descending order according the percentage of overlap.
For each local maxima :
-coordinates in mm x,y,z of the most significative local maxima of the cluster
-list of anatomical label and percentage of overlap. Percentage less than 1% are 
not listed. If part of the region is outside the parcellation the anatomical 
label will list "OUTSIDE".
    
Example : a result of
-44 -22 - 56           	Postcentral_L     55.00
          		Precentral_L     31.00
          		OUTSIDE         10.00
          		Parietal_Sup_L      5.00
indicates that :

55% of the cluster volume is included in the Postcentral_L region
31% of the cluster volume is included in the Precentral_L region
10% of the cluster volume is outside the parcellation
5% of the cluster volume is included in the Parietal_Sup_L region
