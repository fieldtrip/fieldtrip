function [H, Z, S, psi] = sfactorization_wilson(S,freq,Niterations,tol,fb,init,checkflag)

% SFACTORIZATION_WILSON performs multivariate non-parametric spectral factorization on
% cross-spectra, based on Wilson's algorithm.
%
% Usage  : [H, Z, S, psi] = sfactorization_wilson(S,freq);
%
% Inputs : S (1-sided, 3D-spectral matrix in the form of Channel x Channel x frequency) 
%        : freq (a vector of frequencies) at which S is given. 
%
% Outputs: H (transfer function)
%        : Z (noise covariance)
%        : psi (left spectral factor)
%
% This function is an implemention of Wilson's algorithm (Eq. 3.1)
% for spectral matrix factorization

%this also makes it more equivalent to the noisecov estimated by biosig's mvar-function
