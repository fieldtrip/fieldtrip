function dataout = ft_globalmeanfield(cfg, datain)

% FT_GLOBALMEANFIELD calculates global mean field amplitude or power of input data
%
% Use as
%   [gmf] = ft_globalmeanfield(cfg, indata) 
%
% The data should be organised in a structure as obtained from the
% FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS function. The configuration should be according to
% FT_PREPROCESSING function. The configuration should be according to
%
%   cfg.methods   = string, whether the amplitude or power should be calculated (see below, default is 'amplitude')
%   cfg.channel   = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels (default = 'all'),
%                            see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details
%
% This function calculates the global mean field power, or amplitude,
% as described in:
% Lehmann D, Skrandies W. Reference-free identification of components of
% checkerboard-evoked multichannel potential fields. Electroencephalogr Clin
% Neurophysiol. 1980 Jun;48(6):609-21. PubMed PMID: 6155251.
%
% Please note that to calculate what is clasically referred to as Global
% Mean Field Power, cfg.method must be 'amplitude'. The naming implies a
% squared measure but this is not the case. 
%
% To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
%   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
%   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
% If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
% file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
% files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
% input/output structure.
