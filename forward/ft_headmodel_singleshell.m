function headmodel = ft_headmodel_singleshell(mesh, varargin)

% FT_HEADMODEL_SINGLESHELL creates a volume conduction model of the
% head for MEG based on a realistic shaped surface of the inside of
% the skull.
% 
% The method implemented in this function allows for a simple and
% fast method for the MEG forward calculation for one shell of arbitrary
% shape, based on a correction of the lead field for a spherical
% volume conductor by a superposition of basis functions, gradients
% of harmonic functions constructed from spherical harmonics.
% 
% This function implements
%   G. Nolte, "The magnetic lead field theorem in the quasi-static
%   approximation and its use for magnetoencephalography forward calculation
%   in realistic volume conductors", Phys Med Biol. 2003 Nov 21;48(22):3637-52.
% 
% Use as
%   headmodel = ft_headmodel_singleshell(mesh, ...)
