function headmodel = ft_headmodel_halfspace(mesh, Pc, varargin)

% FT_HEADMODEL_HALFSPACE creates an EEG volume conduction model that
% is described with an infinite conductive halfspace. You can think
% of this as a plane with on one side a infinite mass of conductive
% material (e.g. water) and on the other side non-conductive material
% (e.g. air).
%
% Use as
%    headmodel = ft_headmodel_halfspace(mesh, Pc, ...)
% where
%   mesh.pos = Nx3 vector specifying N points through which a plane is fitted 
%   Pc       = 1x3 vector specifying the spatial position of a point lying in the conductive halfspace 
%              (this determines the plane normal's direction)
%
% Additional optional arguments should be specified as key-value pairs and can include
%   'sourcemodel'  = string, 'monopole' or 'dipole' (default = 'dipole')
%   'conductivity' = number,  conductivity value of the conductive halfspace (default = 1)
