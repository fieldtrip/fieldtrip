function [lf] = eeg_leadfieldb(dippos, elc, vol)

% EEG_LEADFIELDB computes the electric leadfield for a dipole in a volume
% using the boundary element method
%
% [lf] = eeg_leadfieldb(dippos, elc, vol)
%
% with the input arguments
%   dippos     position dipole (1x3 or Nx3)
%   elc     position electrodes (optional, can be empty)
%   vol     volume conductor model
%
% the volume conductor model is a structure and should have the fields
%   vol.bnd structure array with vertices and triangles of each boundary
%   vol.cond    conductivity of all compartments
%   vol.mat     system matrix, which can include the electrode interpolation
%
% the compartment boundaries are described by a structure array with
%   vol.bnd(i).pos
%   vol.bnd(i).pos
