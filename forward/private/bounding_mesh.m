function [inside] = bounding_mesh(pos, pnt, tri)

% BOUNDING_MESH determines if a point is inside/outside a triangle mesh 
% whereby the bounding triangle mesh should be closed.
%
% [inside] = bounding_mesh(pos, pnt, tri)
%
% where
%   pos     position of point of interest (can be 1x3 or Nx3)
%   pnt     bounding mesh vertices
%   tri     bounding mesh triangles
