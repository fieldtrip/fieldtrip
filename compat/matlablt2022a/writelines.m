function writelines(lines, filename)

% This is a very limited overloaded version of the MathWorks function WRITELINES
% which has been introduced in MATLAB 2022a. This version does not offer full
% backwards compatibility, it is only capable of writing a cell-array with lines
% to a text file.
%
% The directory containing this function should only be added to the path
% of MATLAB versions prior to 2022a.
