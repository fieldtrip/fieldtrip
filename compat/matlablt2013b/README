This directory contains some functions that allow FieldTrip to run
on older MATLAB versions. These functions emulate the functionality
that is present in the latest MATLAB version.

Each of these directories is called matlabltXXXXX, where "lt" stands
for "less than" and XXXXX is the MATLAB release. If you are using
MATLAB release N, then you should only add the directories N+1,
N+2, ... to your path. In general this will be done automatically
by the ft_defaults function.
