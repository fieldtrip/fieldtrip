function [varargout] = isfile(varargin)

%ISFILE Determine if the input points to a file
%   TF = ISFILE(INPUT) returns true if INPUT points to a file and false otherwise.

% This is a compatibility function that should only be added to the path on
% MATLAB versions prior to 2017b. Note that currently this function only allows
% for a single string in the input, as opposed to the isfile function from MATLAB, which allows for multiple inputs
