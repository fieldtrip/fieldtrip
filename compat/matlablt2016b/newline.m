function [varargout] = newline(varargin)

% NEWLINE Create newline character
%   C = newline creates the character representing a newline.
%   newline is equivalent to char(10) or sprintf('\n').
%
% This is a compatibility function that should only be added to the path on
% MATLAB versions prior to 2016b.
