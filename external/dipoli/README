This directory contains dipoli, which is a linux command line
application for the computation of the EEG-BEM system matrix developed
by Thom Oostendorp (http://www.mbfys.ru.nl/~thom).

He has given me explicit permission to release the dipoli binary
to the general public, under the restriction that he is not bothered
by support requests. If you have questions about the dipoli
application, please address them to the FieldTrip email discussion
list.

Besides the command line application for linux, this directory also
contains a matlab function that acts as warpper around the command
line application. The dipoli wrapper function writes the meshes to
disk, creates a bash shell script and executes that script. In the
script the dipoli command line application will be called. Once the
command line application is finished, the resulting EEG-BEM system
matrix will be read from disk and can subsequently be used by the
FieldTrip forwinv toolbox.
