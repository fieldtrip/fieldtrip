function ri=rindex(dist,partition)
%function ri=rindex(dist,partition)
%
%PURPOSE
%
%To compute a clustering validity index called R-index to assist in
%selecting a proper number of clusters. Input argument
%'partition' defines different clustering results, partitions, of
%the same data. Clustering result that has a (local) minimum value for
%R-index among the compared ones is a "good" one.     
%
%The index is not computed (NaN) if the partition contains a
%cluster consisting of only one item.
%
%INPUT
%
% dist      (NxN matrix) matrix of pairwise dissimilarities between N objects
% partition (KxN matrix) K partition vectors of the same N objects (see
%            explanation for 'partition vector' in function hcluster) 
%
%OUTPUT
%
% ri (Kx1 vector) ri(k) is the value of R-index for clustering
%      given in partition(k,:).
%
%DETAILS
%
%R-index is a Davies-Bouldin type relative clustering validity
%index. The clustering that has the minimum value among is the best
%in terms of R-index. The index is originally defined in Levine &
%Dormay (2001),  "Resampling method for unsupervised estimation of
%cluster validity. Neural Computation, and redescribed in
%publication Himberg et al. (2004), "Validating the independent
%components of neuroimaging time-series via clustering and
%visualization". NeuroImage, 22:3(1214-1222). 13(11). 
%
%NOTE: If the partition contains clusters consisting of only one
%item, the index is especially doubtful and value NaN is assigned
%to the solution.
%
%NOTE 2: the index that is computed here is slightly
%different than in Himberg et al. (2004). In computing
%intra-cluster averages the self-similarities are not included.
