

Notes on the Plexon Neuroshare DLL implementation:


- When returning Ext Events through the ns_GetEventInfo & ns_GetEventData Neuroshare APIs, each individual
 event code is returned as an individual entity, and all strobed event codes are returned as a single entity.
 For all events, a 2-byte data value is always returned.
 For individual events, the data value is the event code.
 For strobed events, the data value is the strobe value.

- For Segment entities, the timestamp reported is the time of the first sample. However, for Neural entities,
 the timestamp reported is the trigger time (including the prethreshold time). Note that this means that timestamps 
 of Segment entities will not in general match the timestamp for the corresponding Neural entity.

- Stereotrode/tetrode data is handled for PLX files with Version 103 or later. The Neuroshare DLL uses the
 'Data' trodalness and not the 'True' trodalness. This means that for stereotrode/tetrode files acquired
 directly from the Plexon MAP system, the Neuroshare DLL will report the data as being single electrode
 because the 'Data' trodalness is 1. This still allows full access to the stereotrode/tetrode data, except
 it is delivered in a single-channel format. To convert a 'raw' stereotrode/tetrode PLX file to have a 'Data'
 trodalness of 2 or 4 (corresponding to stereotrode/tetrode data), the PLX file can be opened and re-saved
 in Offline Sorter.
