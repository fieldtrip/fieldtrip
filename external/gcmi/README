This version of the gcmi toolbox is a copy of Jan-Mathijs' fork, and contains
the 'vec'-branch of Robin's gcmi, merged with 'master', version 0.3. The files
from the matlab folder have been moved one level up, in order for ft_hastoolbox
to automatically detect them, and deal with the path smoothly.
