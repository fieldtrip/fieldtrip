Introduction ------------------------------------------------------------

METIS is a software package for partitioning unstructured graphs, partitioning 
meshes, and computing fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices. 
The documentation of METIS can be found in the Doc/manual.ps file.

METIS is written in ANSI C and should compile on Unix systems that have
a ANSI C compiler. It has been extensively tested on the following
architectures:

   AIX 
   SunOS 
   Solaris 
   IRIX 
   Unicos
   Linux
   HP-UX
   FreeBSD


Installation Instructions -----------------------------------------------

In order to build METIS you need
  (a) a C compiler that is ANSI compatible 
  (b) make 

Edit the file Makefile.in that resides in the same directory as this file 
according to the requirements of your system. In particular you may need
to modify the following:
  1. The CC variable, to be the name of the ANSI C compiler 
     in your system. The GNU C compiler (gcc) will do. 
  2. The settings for the AR and RANLIB variables that are suitable for
     you system. Note that some systems do not have 'ranlib' but they use
     'ar -ts' instead, or it is not needed all together. 
  3. You can use COPTIONS and LDOPTIONS to provide additional command line
     options that are required by your compiler and linker.


After saving the modified Makefile.in, type 'make' at the prompt. This will
build all of METIS's stand-alone programs, METIS's library, and a program that
tests the various partitioning algorithms.
Upon successful completion, make creates the following 11 files:

  pmetis, 
  kmetis, 
  oemetis, 
  onmetis, 
  partnmesh, 
  partdmesh, 
  mesh2nodal,
  mesh2dual,
  graphchk,
  libmetis.a
  Graphs/mtest

Please read the instructions in the file Graphs/0README on how to go and
test the various programs.
