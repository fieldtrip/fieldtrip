    n, dimension of A:                                  5
    nz, number of nonzeros in A:                        14
    symmetry of A:                                      0.8889
    number of nonzeros on diagonal:                     5
    nonzeros in pattern of A+A' (excl. diagonal):       10
    # dense rows/columns of A+A':                       0
    memory used, in bytes:                              228
    # of memory compactions:                            0

    The following approximate statistics are for a subsequent
    factorization of A(P,P) + A(P,P)'.  They are slight upper
    bounds if there are no dense rows/columns in A+A', and become
    looser if dense rows/columns exist.

    nonzeros in L (excluding diagonal):                 5
    nonzeros in L (including diagonal):                 10
    # divide operations for LDL' or LU:                 5
    # multiply-subtract operations for LDL':            6
    # multiply-subtract operations for LU:              7
    max nz. in any column of L (incl. diagonal):        3

    chol flop count for real A, sqrt counted as 1 flop: 22
    LDL' flop count for real A:                         17
    LDL' flop count for complex A:                      93
    LU flop count for real A (with no pivoting):        19
