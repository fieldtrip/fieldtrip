/* LDLSIMPLE:  this is a very simple main program that illustrates the basic
 * usage of the LDL routines.  The output of this program is in ldlsimple.out.
 * This program factorizes the matrix

 * and then solves a system Ax=b whose true solution is
 * x = [.1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 .7 .8 .9 1]' ;
 *
 * Note that Li and Lx are statically allocated, with length 13.  This is just
 * enough to hold the factor L, but normally this size is not known until after
 * ldl_symbolic has analyzed the matrix.  The size of Li and Lx must be greater
 * than or equal to lnz = Lp [N], which is 13 for this matrix L.
