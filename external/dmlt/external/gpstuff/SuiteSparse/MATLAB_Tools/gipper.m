%GIPPER zip selected files and subdirectories (gipper = grep + zip)
%
%   files = gipper (directory, include, exclude, exclude_hidden) ;
%
% Creates a zip file of all files and subdirectories in a directory.  A file in
% the directory or any of its subdirectories whose name matches any expression
% in 'include' via regexp is added to the zip file.  A file that matches any
% expression in 'exclude' is not added.  A subdirectory whose name or full
% pathname matches any expression in 'exclude' is not searched.  The name of
% the zip file is the name of the directory, with '.zip' appended.
%
% 'include' and 'exclude' are either cells of strings, or just single strings.
%
% With no outputs, a list of files is printed and the user is prompted before
% proceeding.  Otherwise, the gipper proceeds without prompting and returns a
% list of files that were added to the zip file.
%
% By default, all files and subdirectories of the directory are included, except
% that hidden files and directories (those whose names start with a dot, '.')
% are excluded.
%
% If any parameter is empty or not present, the defaults are used:
%   directory: defaults to the current directory
%   include: defaults to include all files and directories
%   exclude: defaults to exclude nothing, as modified by 'exclude_hidden'
%   exclude_hidden: 1 (exclude hidden files and directories)
%
% Empty directories or subdirectories are never included.
%
% Example:
%     % suppose 'X' is the name of the current directory.
%
%     % include all files in X (except hidden files) in the zip file ../X.zip
%     gipper
%
%     % create mytoolbox.zip archive of the 'X/mytoolbox' directory
%     gipper mytoolbox
%
%     % only include *.m files in ../X.zip
%     gipper '' '\.m$'
%
%     % create ../X.zip, but exclude compiled object and MEX files
%     gipper ('', '', { '\.o$' '\.obj$', ['\.' mexext '$'] })
%
%     % include everything, including hidden files, in ../X.zip
%     gipper ('', '', '', 0)
%
%     % zip mytoolbox, except hidden files and the mytoolbox/old directory
%     gipper mytoolbox '' old
%
%     % these are the same, except gipper also traverses subdirectories
%     gipper ('', { '\.m$', '\.*mat$' })
%     zip ('../X', { '*.m', '*.mat' })
%
% See also zip, regexp, unzip.

% NOTE: if the directory name is empty or not present, and you hit control-C
% while the gipper is running, your current directory will now be the parent.
% You must install the gipper first, by placing it in your MATLAB path.
