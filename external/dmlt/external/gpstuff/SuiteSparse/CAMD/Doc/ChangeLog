May 31, 2007: version 2.2.0

    * port to 64-bit MATLAB

    * Makefile moved from Source/ to Lib/

Dec 12, 2006, v2.1.3

    * minor MATLAB cleanup

Sept 28, 2006, v2.1.2

    * #define SIZE_T_MAX not done if already defined (Mac OSX).

Aug 31, 2006: v2.1.1

    * trivial change to comments in camd.m

June 27, 2006: CAMD Version 2.1

    * bug fix.  Ordering constraints not always met if dense and/or empty
	nodes are present in the matrix.

Apr. 30, 2006: CAMD Version 2.0

    * CAMD released, based on AMD v2.0.  To compare the two codes, type the
	command ./docdiff in this directory (the "CAMD" and "camd" strings
	are replaced with "AMD" and "amd" when the two packages are compared,
	to make more evident the substantive differences between the packages).

	Primary differences with AMD v2.0:

	CAMD adds the ability to order the matrix with constraints.  Each
	node i in the graph (row/column i in the matrix) has a constraint,
	C[i], which is in the range 0 to n-1.  All nodes with C[i] = 0 are
	ordered first, followed by all nodes with constraint 1, and so on.
	That is, C[P[k]] is monotonically non-decreasing as k varies from 0
	to n-1.  camd_order has an additional C parameter; if NULL, no
	constraints are used (the ordering will be similar to AMD's ordering).
	The optional C parameter is also added to the MATLAB interface,
	p = camd (A,Control,C).

	Since the C parameter is optional, CAMD can replace AMD in any
	application that uses AMD.  Just pass C = NULL (or omit C in the MATLAB
	interface).  There is no Fortran version of CAMD, however.

	The postordering is different, and there is no camd_post_tree.c file.

	A new routine, camd_cvalid, has been added to check the validity of C.

	CAMD requires more workspace than AMD (n+1 integers).

	All user-visible names AMD* and amd* replaced with CAMD* and camd*.
