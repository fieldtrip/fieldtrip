2013-03-12 Version 4.0

New features:
  - Multilatent models: multinomial, softmax, Cox-PH, density
    estimation, density regression, input dependent noise, input
    dependent overdispersion in Weibull, zero-inflated negative binomial
  - Survival models: Cox-PH, Log-Gaussian, Log-logistic, diagnostic criteria
  - Quantile regression
  - PASS-GP active set selection for classification
  - optional memory save in gradient computation

    to use GPstuff with Octave. Following features of v4.0 work only with 
    Matlab:
     - Inputdependent multilatent models
     - Zero-Inflated Negative-Binomial model
     - Cox proportional hazard model
     - Compactly Supported (PPCS*) covariance functions
