function r = trand(nu,m,n)
% TRAND - Random numbers from Student's t-distribution
%
%    R = TRAND(V) returns a matrix of random numbers chosen   
%    from the T distribution with V degrees of freedom.
%    The size of R is the size of V.
%    Alternatively, R = TRAND(V,M,N) returns an M by N matrix.
