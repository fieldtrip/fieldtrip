Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Toolbox written by Kevin Murphy (1998).
See http://www.ai.mit.edu/~murphyk/Software/hmm.html for details.

Installation
------------

1. Install netlab from http://www.ncrg.aston.ac.uk/netlab
2. Install KPMtools and KPMstats from
  http://www.ai.mit.edu/~murphyk/Software/index.html
3. Assuming you installed all these files in your matlab directory, in Matlab type

addpath matlab/netlab
addpath matlab/KPMtools
addpath matlab/KPMstats
addpath matlab/HMM


Models
------

dhmm = HMM with discrete output
mhmm = HMM with mixture of Gaussians output;
 Use mhmm with M=1 components to simulate an HMM with a single Gaussian output.
