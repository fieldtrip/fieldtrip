% usage: y = filtfilt(b, a, x)
%
% Forward and reverse filter the signal. This corrects for phase
% distortion introduced by a one-pass filter, though it does square the
% magnitude response in the process. That's the theory at least.  In
% practice the phase correction is not perfect, and magnitude response
% is distorted, particularly in the stop band.

% Example
%    [b, a]=butter(3, 0.1);                   % 10 Hz low-pass filter
%    t = 0:0.01:1.0;                         % 1 second sample
%    x=sin(2*pi*t*2.3)+0.25*randn(size(t));  % 2.3 Hz sinusoid+noise
%    y = filtfilt(b,a,x); z = filter(b,a,x); % apply filter
%    plot(t,x,';data;',t,y,';filtfilt;',t,z,';filter;')

% Changelog:
% 2000 02 pkienzle@kienzle.powernet.co.uk
%      - pad with zeros to load up the state vector on filter reverse.
%      - add example
% 2007 12 pot@gnu.org
%	    - use filtic to compute initial and final states
%      - work for multiple columns as well
% 2008 12 lciti@essex.ac.uk
%      - fixed instability issues with IIR filters and noisy inputs
%	    - initial states computed according to Likhterov & Kopeika, 2003
%      - use of a "reflection method" to reduce end effects
%      - added some basic tests

% TODO:  (pkienzle) My version seems to have similar quality to matlab,
%	but both are pretty bad.  They do remove gross lag errors, though.
