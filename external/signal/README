This directory contains a selection of Octave functions that were downloaded from
http://octave.sourceforge.net/signal/index.html and modified to
make them MATLAB compatible. They serve as drop-in replacement for
some functions in the Mathworks signal processing toolbox.

Note that the hilbert and hanning functions are not from the Octave toolbox, 
these have been taken from SPM (hilbert), or were handcrafted (hanning)

Updates:
Jan 11, 2022 by Jan-Mathijs, using version
[4fcb75] (i.e. the default branch) from 
https://sourceforge.net/p/octave/signal/ci/default/tree/

May 16, 2022 by Jan-Mathijs, added functionality for resample:
-upsample
-downsample
-upfirdn
-resample
-firls
-fir1
-fir2
Note: resample has been adjusted as to match the default implementation in MATLAB (2021b), i.e. using a (non-configurable) beta parameter for the Kaiser window of 5, and using a firls anti-aliasing filter, instead of a sinc filter
