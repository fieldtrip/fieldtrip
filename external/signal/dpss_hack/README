This is a hack to implement the DPSS sequence of Slepian tapers. I
made it for the 2013 Toronto workshop, where we had to go through
the tutorials without the signal processing toolbox on the participants'
computers. This hack will result in a reasonable approximation of
the DPSS tapers in case your settings are comparable to the ones
used in precomputing the tapers. Otherwise the approximation might
be far off. Please only use this when you know what you are doing
and don't complain, but rather purchase the Mathworks signal
processing toolbox.
