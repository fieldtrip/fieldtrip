The brain connectivity toolbox contains a large selection of complex network measures in Matlab. 
These measures are increasingly used to characterize structural and functional brain connectivity datasets. 
Several people have contributed to the toolbox, and if you wish to contribute with a new function or set of 
functions, please contact Olaf Sporns.

All efforts have been made to avoid errors, but users are strongly urged to independently verify the accuracy
and suitability of toolbox functions for the chosen application. Please report bugs or substantial improvements
to Olaf Sporns or to Mika Rubinov.
