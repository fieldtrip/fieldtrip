function bd = mne_block_diag(A,n);
%
%   function bd = mne_block_diag(A,n)
%
%   Make or extract a sparse block diagonal matrix
%
%   If A is not sparse, then returns a sparse block diagonal "bd", diagonalized from the
%   elements in "A".
%   "A" is ma x na, comprising bdn=(na/"n") blocks of submatrices.
%   Each submatrix is ma x "n", and these submatrices are
%   placed down the diagonal of the matrix.
%
%   If A is already sparse, then the operation is reversed, yielding a block
%   row matrix, where each set of n columns corresponds to a block element
%   from the block diagonal.
%
%   Routine uses NO for-loops for speed considerations.
