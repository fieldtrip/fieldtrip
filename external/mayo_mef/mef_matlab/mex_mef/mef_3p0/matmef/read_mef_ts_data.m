%   Read the MEF3 data from a time-series channel
%	
%   [data] = read_mef_ts_data(channel, rangeType, rangeStart, rangeEnd)
%	
%   channelPath     = path (absolute or relative) to the MEF3 channel folder
%   password        = password to the MEF3 data; Pass empty string/variable if not encrypted
%   rangeType       = Modality that is used to define the data-range to read [either 'time' or 'samples']
%   rangeStart      = Start-point for the reading of data (either as an epoch/unix timestamp or samplenumber)
%                     Pass -1 to start at the first sample of the timeseries
%   rangeEnd        = End-point to stop the of reading data (either as an epoch/unix timestamp or samplenumber)
%                     Pass -1 as value to end at the last sample of the timeseries
%
%   Returns: 
%       data        = A vector of doubles holding the channel data
%
%   Note:  When the rangeType is set to 'samples', the function simply returns the samples as they are
%          found (consecutively) in the datafile, without any regard for time or data gaps; Meaning 
%          that, if there is a time-gap between samples, then these will not appear in the result returned.
%          In contrast, the 'time' rangeType will return the data with NaN values in place for the missing samples.
