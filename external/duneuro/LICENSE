General Info:

DUNEuro is an open-source C++ software library for solving partial differential equations (PDE) in neurosciences using mesh bases methods. It is based on the DUNE library and its main features include solving the EEG and MEG forward problem and providing simulations for brain stimulation.

As distributed on the DUNEuro GitLab, the source code works only on Linux operating systems. Interfaces to Matlab and Python are possible, but you need to install and compile duneuro by yourself (more documentation). For FieldTrip, we adapted this code and were able to generate binaries for Linux, which are downloaded automatically when needed.

As a special exception, you may use the duneuro source files as part of a software library or application without restriction.  Specifically, if other 
files instantiate templates or use macros or inline functions from one or more of the duneuro source files, or you compile one or more of the duneuro source files and link them with other files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License.  This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.

This license is intended to be similar to the GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 2, which by itself isn't suitable for a template library. You can find a copy of the GNU General Public License, Version 2, in the file GPL-2 or at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.
