function status = besa_save2Elp(file_path, file_name, ...
    spherical_coordinates, channel_labels, channel_type)
% BESA_SAVE2ELP writes a matrix of spherical coordinates into ASCII file 
% in the ELP-format. 
%
% Parameters:
%     [file_path]
%         Full path to the folder where the file should be saved.
% 
%     [file_name]
%         The name of the file where the output should be written.
% 
%     [spherical_coordinates]
%         A 2D matrix containing the coordinates. It should have the size
%         [NumberOfChannels x 2(or 3)]. For each row the structure should
%         be [theta, phi, (r)], the radius r is optional and is not needed
%         for the export, since it is assumed that the coordinates are on
%         unit sphere and r is always 1.
% 
%     [channel_labels]
%         A cell-array of strings containing the channel labels for the 
%         current data. It is also accepted if this a regular array 
%         containing the channel labels separated with whitespaces.   
% 
%     [channel_type]
%         A single string containing the type of the channels. Possible
%         values are: MEG, EEG, POL, ICR.
% 
% 
% Return:
%     [status] 
%         The status of the writing process: 0 if the process was 
%         successful and less than 0 if not.
