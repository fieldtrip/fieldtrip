This directory contains a subset of the functions from the Freesurfer
package. These functions are provided as courtesy to the FieldTrip
users, and provide just enough functionality to provide an interface between
FieldTrip and the files as they are created by Freesurfer.

In older versions, the listed files were taken from version 4.5.0 (64 bit). Comparing against version 4.3.0 (32 bit) yielded no differences of relevance. For the unlisted files, the origin was not specified.
