% Statistical Parametric Mapping  refers to the construction and assessment 
% of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about
% functional imaging data.  These ideas have been  instantiated in software 
% that is called SPM.
% The  SPM software package  has been designed  for the  analysis of  brain 
% imaging  data  sequences.  The sequences  can be a  series of images from 
% different  cohorts,  or time-series  from the  same subject.  The current 
% release is designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG and MEG.
%
% SPM  is  developed  under the  auspices of  Functional Imaging Laboratory
% (FIL)  The  Wellcome  Trust Centre  for  Neuroimaging,  in the  Institute
% of Neurology at University College London (UCL), UK.
