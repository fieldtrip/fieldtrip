This directory contains a subset of the functions from the SPM8
package. These functions are provided as courtesy to the FieldTrip
users, and provide just enough functionality to do segmentation and
anatomical realigmnent.

See https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ and https://github.com/spm for details.
