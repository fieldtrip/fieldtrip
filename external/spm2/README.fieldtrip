This directory contains a subset of the functions from the SPM2
package. These functions are provided as courtesy to the FieldTrip
users, and provide just enough functionality to do segmentation and
anatomical realigmnent.

The only difference in these functions compared to the official
SPM2 release is that the "isprivate" function has been fixed to work
on recent MATLAB releases.

See https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ and https://github.com/spm for details.
