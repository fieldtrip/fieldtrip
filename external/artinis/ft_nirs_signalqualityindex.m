function dataout = ft_nirs_signalqualityindex(cfg, datain)

% FT_NIRS_SIGNALQUALITYINDEX processes NIRS data and returns a copy of the original
% data replaced with nans in the signal segements that are bellow the specified
% quality threshold.
%
% Use as
%   dataout = ft_nirs_signalqualityindex(cfg, datain)
% where cfg is a configuration structure and indata is raw NIRS-data (in optical
% densities, ODs) that is represented according to the output of FT_PREPROCESSING.
%
% The configuration should contain the following options
%   cfg.threshold    = scalar, the SQI (signal quality index) value that
%                      has to be exceeded to be labelled as a 'good'
%                      channel (default = 3.5)
%   cfg.windowlength = scalar, the length (in seconds) of the signal
%                      segments to be analyzed (default = 10)

%   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
% If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
% file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
% files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the% input/output structure.
