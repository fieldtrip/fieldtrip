function dataout = ft_nirs_scalpcouplingindex(cfg, datain)

% FT_NIRS_SCALPCOUPLINGINDEX computes the zero-lag cross-correlation 
% between pairs of raw NIRS-channels to identify bad channels. 
%
% Use as
%   [outdata] = ft_scalpcouplingindex(cfg, indata)
% where indata is raw NIRS-data (in optical densities, ODs)
% and cfg is a configuration structure that should contain
%
%  cfg.threshold    = scalar, the correlation value which has to be
%                     exceeded to be labelled a 'good' channel (default
%                     0.75)
%
% To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
%   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
%   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
% If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
% file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
% files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
% input/output structure.

% the initial part deals with parsing the input options and data
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% these are used by the ft_preamble/ft_postamble function and scripts
ft_revision = '$Id$';
ft_nargin   = nargin;
ft_nargout  = nargout;

% do the general setup of the function

% the ft_preamble function works by calling a number of scripts from
% fieldtrip/utility/private that are able to modify the local workspace

ft_defaults                   % this ensures that the path is correct and that the ft_defaults global variable is available
ft_preamble init              % this will reset ft_warning and show the function help if nargin==0 and return an error
ft_preamble debug             % this allows for displaying or saving the function name and input arguments upon an error
ft_preamble loadvar    datain % this reads the input data in case the user specified the cfg.inputfile option
ft_preamble provenance datain % this records the time and memory usage at the beginning of the function
ft_preamble trackconfig       % this converts the cfg structure in a config object, which tracks the cfg options that are being used

% the ft_abort variable is set to true or false in ft_preamble_init
if ft_abort
  % do not continue function execution in case the outputfile is present and the user indicated to keep it
  return
end

% ensure that the input data is raw NIRS-data, this will also do
% backward-compatibility conversions of old data that for example was
% read from an old *.mat file
datain = ft_checkdata(datain, 'datatype', 'raw', 'senstype', 'nirs');

% get the options
cfg.threshold    = ft_getopt(cfg, 'threshold', 0.75);

ft_postamble previous   datain   % this copies the datain.cfg structure into the cfg.previous field. You can also use it for multiple inputs, or for "varargin"
ft_postamble provenance dataout  % this records the time and memory at the end of the function, prints them on screen and adds this information together with the function name and MATLAB version etc. to the output cfg
ft_postamble history    dataout  % this adds the local cfg structure to the output data structure, i.e. dataout.cfg = cfg
ft_postamble savevar    dataout  % this saves the output data structure to disk in case the user specified the cfg.outputfile option
