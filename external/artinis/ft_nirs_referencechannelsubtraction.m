function dataout = ft_nirs_referencechannelsubtraction(cfg, datain)

% FT_NIRS_REFERENCECHANNELSUBTRACTION performs NIRS reference channel subtraction
%
% Use as
%   dataout = ft_nirs_referencechannelsubtraction(cfg, datain)
% where cfg is a configuration structure and indata is raw NIRS-data that is
% represented according to the output of FT_PREPROCESSING.
%
% The configuration should contain the following options
%   cfg.shortdistance = scalar, below which distance a channel is regarded
%                       as short in cm (default = 1.5)
%   cfg.closedistance = scalar, defines the maximal distance between a
%                       long and a short channel in cm (default = 15).
%                       NOT APPLIED CURRENTLY!
%   cfg.method        = string, 'regstat2', 'QR' or 'OLS' (default = 'QR')
%   cfg.verbose       = boolean, whether text output is desired (default = false)
%
% To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
%   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
%   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
% If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
% file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
% files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
% input/output structure.
