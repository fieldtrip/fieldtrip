   Please download the latest v1.5.0 release at our
   [8]registration/download page. We are greatly appreciated if you can
   tell us a little bit about you and your related research by
   [9]registering your copy of iso2mesh.
     * Release date: July 16, 2013
     * This software is supported on [os-icons3.png]

iso2mesh 1.4.9, codenamed Laba Porridge (beta)

   Please download the stable v1.4.9 release at our
   [10]registration/download page.
     * Release date: Jan. 20, 2013

2. Download Development Snapshot from SVN (not fully tested)

   If you want to get the latest development branch of iso2mesh, you have
   to download it from our subversion (SVN) repository. You have to be
   aware that an SVN snapshot is not a stable release. It may contain
   partially implemented features and, thus, cause crash or erroneous
   results.

   First, make sure you have installed an SVN client on your system. If
   your system is a Debian-based GNU/Linux system (such as Ubuntu, Knoppix
   etc), you can install SVN by
 sudo apt-get install subversion

   if you are using a Redhat-based GNU/Linux system (such as Fedora,
   CentOS etc), you can do this by
 su -c 'yum install subversion'

   If your operating system is Windows, we recommend you installing
   [11]TortoiseSVN.

2.1. Anonymous SVN Access

   The latest code snapshot can be checked out from project's [12]SVN
   repository. It can be checked out anonymously by the following command.

 svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/iso2mesh/code/trunk/iso2mesh iso2mesh

   After checking out the code, you need to set up the path based on the
   [13]installation instructions. Then you can start matlab or octave, and
   run the example scripts under the sample directory.

2.2. Developer SVN Access

   If you are one of the developers who have SVN write-permission, you can
   checkout the latest code with the same command above.

   You will have to [14]register an account and ask the [15]project
   maintainer to grant you SVN permission).

   Once checkout, you can simply make changes or debug your changes in
   your local copy. If your local changes have passed review by other
   co-developers, you can then commit your changes back to the SVN
   repository by

 cd /path/to/iso2mesh/local/copy
 svn commit -m "a short summary of your changes"

3. Important Note on Licenses

   The iso2mesh toolbox is licensed under [16]GNU Public License (GPL).
   However, it included a number of external tools (under bin/ directory)
   to perform certain functionality by means of [17]pipelines. These
   external tools are subjected to their upstream licenses and are not
   necessarily GPL (or GPL compatible). The complete list of these
   external commands and their author info and licenses can be found from
   the [18]README page.

   Particularly, the 3D meshing tool, tetgen, is licensed under a non-free
   license: it can be freely used, modified, redistributed only for
   research and academic purposes, any commercial utility of tetgen
   requires a permission from its [19]original author. iso2mesh calls
   tetgen in the background to produce 3D mesh, that means if anyone needs
   to uses the 3D mesh produced by iso2mesh in a commercial product, you
   MUST contact the author of tetgen to get permission. Processing binary
   images and produce surfaces are not subject to this limitation.

   In additional to the licenses, if you use this tool in your research,
   we are greatly appreciated if you can add iso2mesh to your references:

 Qianqian Fang, iso2mesh: a matlab-based 3D tetrahedral mesh generator, URL: [20]http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net, 2008

   or

 Qianqian Fang and David Boas, "Tetrahedral mesh generation from volumetric binary and gray-scale images,"
 Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2009, pp. 1142-1145, 2009

   If you used cgalsurf or cgalmesh options in your mesh preparation, you
   should also acknowledge [21]CGAL publications. If you generated your
   mesh with the tetgen module in iso2mesh instead of CGAL mesher, you may
   need to [22]acknowledge tetgen in your publications, you can find more
   references from [23]this link.
