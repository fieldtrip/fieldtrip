   #[1]iso2mesh: a Matlab/Octave-based mesh generator

Getting Started with iso2mesh

   Although iso2mesh provides a rich collection of [2]mesh-related
   functions, the core functionality, i.e. creating volumetric meshes from
   surfaces or binary image stacks, is very straightforward to use. A
   minimum step to perform such task only requires about 3 to 5 lines of
   matlab code. You can find a list of examples under the "sample"
   directory. In [3]this page, we summarize the overall work-flow of this
   toolbox.

   To outline a simple meshing session, let's assume you have a 3D image
   array, named "mydata", saved in a file called "mydata.mat". Variable
   mydata can be any 3D image, a MRI/CT scan or a simple binary mask
   produced by your own command. Here are the commands you need to produce
   a volumetric FEM mesh from this volume:

 load mydata.mat
 [node,elem,face]=v2m(mydata,0.5,5,100);
 plotmesh(node,face)

   Needless to say, the first line loads the data to your current session.
   The second line calls an iso2mesh function, 'v2m', the shortcut for
   vol2mesh, to construct a volumetric mesh from this data array. The
   first argument of v2m, "mydata", is the volumetric image you are about
   to mesh; the 2nd argument is the threshold value at which you define
   the boundary surface of the mesh; the 3rd argument, 5, defines the
   maximum size of the surface triangles; the last argument, 100, defines
   the maximum volume of the resulting tetrahedral elements. You can
   define a vector for the second argument, asking iso2mesh to produce
   multiple level-sets as the exterior or internal interfaces of the
   target domain. Both the 3rd and 4th arguments controls the density of
   the resulting mesh: the smaller the values, the more triangles on the
   surface and more tetrahedra in the volumetric mesh.

   There are 3 outputs from v2m command:
     * node: the node coordinates for the generated volumetric mesh, with
       dimension of NN x 3, with each column being x, y and z,
       respectively.
     * elem: the tetrahedral element info, with a dimension of NE x 4;
       each row represents an element, and each column are the node
       indices for each corner of a tetrahedron.
     * face: triangular surface element info, with a dimension of NS x
       4,;the first 3 columns are the node indices of each corner of the
       triangle, and the last column is a flag to identify its mapping to
       the original surface id.
