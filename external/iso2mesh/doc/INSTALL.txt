   #[1]iso2mesh: a Matlab/Octave-based mesh generator

Installation Instructions for iso2mesh toolbox

System Requirements

   Iso2mesh is written in the Matlab language and is fully compatible with
   [2]GNU Octave, as a result, any system that is capable of running
   Matlab or Octave is able to run this toolbox in theory. However, as we
   described in the [3]Doc/README, this toolbox relies on multiple
   external tools/libraries for full functionality. So far, we have only
   compiled these external tools for Linux (32/64bit), Mac OS (Intel based
   or PowerPC based) and Windows (95~Windows 7, 32/64bit). If your
   platform is not listed above (such as Solaris, AIX etc), please
   download the [4]source code of these tools and compile them on your own
   machine.

   The recommended system configuration for running this toolbox includes
     * a computer running GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS (either 32bit/64bit)
     * standard installation of Matlab (v7 or above) or Octave (3.0 or
       above) (for some demos, you need to install the image processing
       toolbox for Matlab/Octave)
     * 30M disk space for the toolbox and the examples
     * a folder where you have write permission

Installation

   The installation of iso2mesh to your system is straightforward,
   simplify following the instructions below:
     * extract the downloaded package to a folder, for example,
       /home/myaccount/work/iso2mesh, let's call it the "root directory"
       of iso2mesh;
     * start your Maltab, type addpath('/home/myaccount/work/iso2mesh') to
       add iso2mesh to your Matlab search path for the current session
          + if you want to add this path permanently for Matlab, you need
            to type pathtool, browse to the iso2mesh root directory and
            add it to the list, then click "Save"
     * then, you can do a rehash in Matlab, and type which vol2mesh, if
       you see an output, that means iso2mesh is now installed in Matlab
     * you can navigate to a folder named "sample" inside iso2mesh's root
       directory, and run the demo scripts, you should be able to see the
       code complete with no error message. If it complains that some
       commands can not be found, please make sure you have followed the
       instructions above.

For restricted users

   You do not have to be a system administrator to install or use iso2mesh
   toolbox. Most of the installation instructions can be done on a
   per-user basis. The only issue a restricted user may encounter is the
   "permission error" when saving the "pathtool" path list in order to add
   iso2mesh permanently. If this happens, you may work in a multi-user or
   network-based system. For Matlab users, you typically need to create
   file named [5]startup.m under the [6]Matlab startup directory
   (~/matlab/ for Linux/Unix), and put addpath('/path/to/iso2mesh/'); into
   this file. It will be automatically executed when Matlab starts. For
   Octave, this file is [7].octaverc.

   When using this toolbox under an extensively restricted mode, one may
   encounter a "fail to write" error, this may likely be caused by the
   default output folder is not writable from your account. If you do have
   another folder which you have permission to write, you need to
   [8]define an variable ISO2MESH_TEMP in Matlab/Octave's "base workspace"
   and set the value as the writable folder path, then rerun your meshing
   commands.
