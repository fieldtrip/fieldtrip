This directory contains toolboxes that are not maintained by the FieldTrip
maintainers. These toolboxes are or can be used in combination with
FieldTrip and are provided here with permission of the original toolbox
authors as courtesy to the end-users.

Note that for some toolboxes we only include a "lite" version pruned
down to the functions that FieldTrip needs. This is especially the
case with large toolboxes, like SPM.

Furthermore, the version of the toolboxes included here is in general
not always the latest one but one that has been tested and that we
know to work.

If you need a more up-to-date or more complete version of the toolbox,
please download it from its respective site where it is maintained.
