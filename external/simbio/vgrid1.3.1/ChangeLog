Vgrid version 1.3

* added support for 3D OpenDX output

* lowered memory consumption
	
Vgrid version 1.2

* fixed bug in marching tets when more than 2 nom-background 
  materials are involved: Spurious cells of the meshed material
  occured outside this material region.

* Fixed bug in  gridGenerator::removeNonSurfaceVertices()
  The new vertex graph now contains vertex links, thus 
  enabling smoothing of surface meshes.
