*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSYSVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
*  solution to a real system of linear equations A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
*  matrices.
*
*  Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
*  provided.
*
*  Description
*  ===========
*
*  The following steps are performed:
*
*  1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A.
*     The form of the factorization is
*        A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*        A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*     where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*     triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
*     1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
*
*  2. The factored form of A is used to estimate the condition number
*     of the matrix A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
*     less than machine precision, steps 3 and 4 are skipped.
*
*  3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
*     of A.
*
*  4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
*     matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
*     for it.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  FACT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether or not the factored form of A has been
*          supplied on entry.
*          = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of
*                  A.  AF and IPIV will not be modified.
*          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
*          matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
*          upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part
*          of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A
*          is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
*          triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of
*          the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is
*          not referenced.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  AF      (input or output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAF,N)
*          If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
*          contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
*          to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
*          A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by DSYTRF.
*
*          If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
*          returns the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
*          to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
*          A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T.
*
*  LDAF    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
*
*  IPIV    (input or output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
*          contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
*          of D, as determined by DSYTRF.
*          If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*          If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
*          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
*          is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
*          IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*
*          If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
*          contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
*          of D, as determined by DSYTRF.
*
*  B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  X       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
*          If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
*
*  LDX     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
*          A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
*          particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
*          precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
*          INFO > 0, and the solution and error bounds are not computed.
*
*  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bounds for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution, FERR(j) bounds the magnitude
*          of the largest entry in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the
*          magnitude of the largest entry in X(j).  The quality of the
*          error bound depends on the quality of the estimate of
*          norm(inv(A)) computed in the code; if the estimate of
*          norm(inv(A)) is accurate, the error bound is guaranteed.
*
*  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in any
*          entry of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LWORK)
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The length of WORK.  LWORK >= 3*N, and for best performance
*          LWORK >= N*NB, where NB is the optimal blocksize for
*          DSYTRF.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, and i is
*               <= N: D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization has
*                     has been completed, but the block diagonal
*                     matrix D is exactly singular, so the solution and
*                     error bounds could not be computed.
*               = N+1: the block diagonal matrix D is nonsingular, but
*                     RCOND is less than machine precision.  The
*                     factorization has been completed, but the matrix
*                     is singular to working precision, so the solution
*                     and error bounds have not been computed.
