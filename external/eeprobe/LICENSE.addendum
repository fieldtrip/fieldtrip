LIBEEP License Addendum.


1. License.  The LIBEEP Library (the "Library") is licensed under 
GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software 
Foundation, version 3 of the License. 


2. Relinking Exemption.  You may distribute a combined work using a 
statically linked, unmodified copy of the Library under terms of your 
choice, without the relinking requirement stipulated under the GNU Lesser 
Public License, subject to the following conditions:  

a) This static relinking exemption covers only the LIBEEP. Other libraries 
which the LIBEEP may need are covered by their own respective licenses. 

b) Modification of the configure scripts, makefiles, or installation tools 
of the LIBEEP to support a specific platform does not constitute creating a 
modified copy based on the Library. 

c) Programs or binaries statically linked with the Library must be identified 
as such by including, in the Documentation or by other means (for example in 
the About Box or Online Help), the following statement:

"This software uses the LIBEEP Library (http://libeep.sourceforge.net)."


d) Subclassing from Objects or Widgets supplied by the Library involves no 
modifications to the source code of the Library itself, and does not 
constitute creating a modified copy based on the Library.


3. This LIBEEP License Addendum does not automatically apply to derivative 
works. When making derivative works based on the LIBEEP Library, this license 
addendum ceases to apply, and code will revert to the simple GNU Lesser 
General Public License. The Relinking Exemption only applies to unmodified 
versions of the Library.  


4. If you do not accept or are unable to meet the conditions under (2), you 
may continue to distribute the combined work under the original GNU Lesser 
General Public License.
