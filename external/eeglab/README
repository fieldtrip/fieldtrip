EEGLAB is an interactive Matlab toolbox for processing continuous
and event-related EEG, MEG and other electrophysiological data using
independent component analysis (ICA), time/frequency analysis,
artifact rejection, and several modes of data visualization. First
developed on Matlab 5.3 under Linux, EEGLAB runs on Matlab v5-7
under Linux, Unix, Windows, and Mac OS (current v7 recommended).

See http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab for details.

that are used in FieldTrip. The fiunctions here correspond to the
official EEGLAB release version 6.01b.
