% jader() - blind separation of real signals using JADE (v1.5, Dec. 1997).
%
% Usage: 
%   >> B = jader(X);
%   >> B = jader(X,m);
%
% Notes:
%  1) If X is an nxT data matrix (n sensors, T samples) then
%     B=jader(X) is a nxn separating matrix such that S=B*X is an nxT
%     matrix of estimated source signals.
%  2) If B=jader(X,m), then B has size mxn so that only m sources are
%     extracted.  This is done by restricting the operation of jader
%     to the m first principal components. 
%  3) Also, the rows of B are ordered such that the columns of pinv(B)
%     are in order of decreasing norm; this has the effect that the
%     `most energetically significant' components appear first in the
%     rows of S=B*X.

% Quick notes (more at the end of this file)
%
%  o this code is for REAL-valued signals.  An implementation of JADE
%    for both real and complex signals is also available from
%    http://sig.enst.fr/~cardoso/stuff.html
%
%  o This algorithm differs from the first released implementations of
%    JADE in that it has been optimized to deal more efficiently
%    1) with real signals (as opposed to complex)
%    2) with the case when the ICA model does not necessarily hold.
%
%  o There is a practical limit to the number of independent
%    components that can be extracted with this implementation.  Note
%    that the first step of JADE amounts to a PCA with dimensionality
%    reduction from n to m (which defaults to n).  In practice m
%    cannot be `very large' (more than 40, 50, 60... depending on
%    available memory)
%
%  o See more notes, references and revision history at the end of
%    this file and more stuff on the WEB
%    http://sig.enst.fr/~cardoso/stuff.html
%
%  o This code is supposed to do a good job!  Please report any
%    problem to cardoso@sig.enst.fr

%   - Minor clean up.
%   - Added a verbose switch

%  Notes:
%  ======
%
%  Note 1)
%
%  The original Jade algorithm/code deals with complex signals in
%  Gaussian noise white and exploits an underlying assumption that the
%  model of independent components actually holds.  This is a
%  reasonable assumption when dealing with some narrowband signals.
%  In this context, one may i) seriously consider dealing precisely
%  with the noise in the whitening process and ii) expect to use the
%  small number of significant eigenmatrices to efficiently summarize
%  all the 4th-order information.  All this is done in the JADE
%  algorithm.
%
%  In this implementation, we deal with real-valued signals and we do
%  NOT expect the ICA model to hold exactly.  Therefore, it is
%  pointless to try to deal precisely with the additive noise and it
%  is very unlikely that the cumulant tensor can be accurately
%  summarized by its first n eigen-matrices. Therefore, we consider
%  the joint diagonalization of the whole set of eigen-matrices.
%  However, in such a case, it is not necessary to compute the
%  eigenmatrices at all because one may equivalently use `parallel
%  slices' of the cumulant tensor.  This part (computing the
%  eigen-matrices) of the computation can be saved: it suffices to
%  jointly diagonalize a set of cumulant matrices.  Also, since we are
%  dealing with reals signals, it becomes easier to exploit the
%  symmetries of the cumulants to further reduce the number of
%  matrices to be diagonalized.  These considerations, together with
%  other cheap tricks lead to this version of JADE which is optimized
%  (again) to deal with real mixtures and to work `outside the model'.
%  As the original JADE algorithm, it works by minimizing a `good set'
%  of cumulants.
%
%  Note 2) 
%
%  The rows of the separating matrix B are resorted in such a way that
%  the columns of the corresponding mixing matrix A=pinv(B) are in
%  decreasing order of (Euclidian) norm.  This is a simple, `almost
%  canonical' way of fixing the indetermination of permutation.  It
%  has the effect that the first rows of the recovered signals (ie the
%  first rows of B*X) correspond to the most energetic *components*.
%  Recall however that the source signals in S=B*X have unit variance.
%  Therefore, when we say that the observations are unmixed in order
%  of decreasing energy, the energetic signature is found directly as
%  the norm of the columns of A=pinv(B).
%
%  Note 3) 
%  
%  In experiments where JADE is run as B=jadeR(X,m) with m varying in
%  range of values, it is nice to be able to test the stability of the
%  decomposition.  In order to help in such a test, the rows of B can
%  be sorted as described above. We have also decided to fix the sign
%  of each row in some arbitrary but fixed way.  The convention is
%  that the first element of each row of B is positive.
%
%
%  Note 4) 
%
%  Contrary to many other ICA algorithms, JADE (or least this version)
%  does not operate on the data themselves but on a statistic (the
%  full set of 4th order cumulant).  This is represented by the matrix
%  CM below, whose size grows as m^2 x m^2 where m is the number of
%  sources to be extracted (m could be much smaller than n).  As a
%  consequence, (this version of) JADE will probably choke on a
%  `large' number of sources.  Here `large' depends mainly on the
%  available memory and could be something like 40 or so.  One of
%  these days, I will prepare a version of JADE taking the `data'
%  option rather than the `statistic' option.
