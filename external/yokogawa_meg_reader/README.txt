This directory contains code for importing MEG data from the YOKOGAWA system. This code was initially
developped and contributed by YOKOGAWA, but its MEG activities have been transferred to RICOH.
The code is now the responsibility of RICOH.

Please see the "EULA for YOKOGAWA MEG Reader Toolbox.pdf" document for the software license agreement.
