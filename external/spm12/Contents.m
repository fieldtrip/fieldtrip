%
% Statistical Parametric Mapping refers to the construction and assessment 
% of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about
% functional imaging data.  These ideas have been instantiated in software 
% that is called SPM.
% The  SPM software package has been designed for the analysis of brain 
% imaging data  sequences.  The sequences can be a series of images from 
% different cohorts, or time-series from the same subject.  The current 
% release is designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG and MEG.
%
% SPM is developed under the auspices of Functional Imaging Laboratory
% (FIL) The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, in the Institute of
% Neurology at University College London (UCL), UK.
