REQUIREMENTS

This is a MATLAB package. The command line version requires MATLAB v6.1 
and the graphical user interface v7. 

INSTALLATION

Copy archive into proper directory and unpack it

> gtar -xvzf dss_package.tar.gz

Add DSS package (directory where 'dss.m' is located) to the Matlab path.
Use absolute path definition.
   a) Use Matlab pathtool to add path.
OR
   b) Add line to the startup.m in your home directory
        addpath('/path/to/dss')
OR
   c) Add item to the p vector in ~/.matlab/pathdef.m
        '/path/to/dss:',...

If you want to use keyboard to interrupt calculation (so that it can
be continued afterwards), MEX or java function must be set to handle
keypresses.  To set up java keyboard interrupt modify 'classpath.txt'
file and add path to dss directory on a new line or set the path using
MATLABs javaclasspath command. To set up MEX keyboard interrupt a
testkeypress-function must be compiled with 'prepare.m' script. This
requires that MEX compiler environment is properly set up.


GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE

DSS package contains a graphical user interface (GUI). See README in
gui-directory for more information. 

USAGE

DSS can be run with default parameters simply by passing the mixed
signal matrix as a single parameter. The result is the state structure
containing the details of the run. The state structure allows long
calculations to be interrupted and continued later on. The algorithm
also copies the essential results to the other output arguments.

>> [state] = denss(X)
>> [state, W, A, ...] = denss(X)

The algorithm can be interrupted by a control user interface or
pressing the SPACE-key and choosing the proper interrupt option.
After interruption, the calculation can be continued
by giving the state structure as a parameter.

>> [state, ...] = denss(state)

The parameters are given to the algorithm in a parameter structure that is
similar to the state structure. Parameters can be also given as
a cell array containing parameter and value pairs.
The initialization of the state script can be done in
a separate initialization function.
Also an existing state structure can be updated with new parameters.

% create new parameter structure, set the source dimension to 3
>> params.sdim = 3

% use symmetric approach
>> params.algorithm = 'symm'

% run algorithm with existing parameter structure
>> [state, ...] = denss(X, params)

% run algorithm by passing parameters directly
>> [state, ...] = denss(X, {'sdim', 3, 'algorithm', 'symm', ...})

% create algorithm state structure from parameter structure
>> state = dss_create_state(X, params)

% run algorithm with previously created state structure or
% continue interrupted calculation
>> [state, ...] = denss(state)

% update the algorithm state structure with new parameters
>> state = dss_create_state(state, params)

% run algorithm with existing state structure together with new parameters
>> [state, ...] = denss(state, params)

Some description of the parameters can be found from the files denss.m
and dss_init.m. DSS algorithm customization is made mostly by
providing custom functions for various algorithm operations.

See the demos in the demos directory for more information.

NOTES

MATLAB uses a clever pass-by-reference-or-value in function
calls. This means that passed variables are not copied (which would
take some CPU-time) if the function does not change them. For this
reason, one should avoid changing e.g. the state variable in the
denoising functions, even if it is not returned (no change would be
visible in the main program). Instead, make local copies of the
relevant parts in the denoising function.

If you have run the dss algorithm once and would like to run it again,
you have to clear the fields 'S' and 'W' from the state
struct. Otherwise, dss will start from the predefined S (or W).
