function [triggerLinesGood, triggerCounts, triggersList, fs] = sqdgettriggers(sqdfile, triggerLinesPotential, triggerHighThresh, triggerLowThresh)

%SQDGETTRIGGERS Detects trigger lines and triggers on those lines from an MEG sqd file.
%
%    [triggerLines, triggerCounts, triggersList, fs] = SQDGETTRIGGERS(sqdfile, triggerLinesPotential, triggerHighThresh, triggerLowThresh);
%
%    OUTPUT variables:
%    triggerLines: which lines were actually used as trigger lines
%    triggerCounts: how many triggers were detected on each trigger line
%    triggersList: a cell array (each cell corresponds to a
%       different trigger line) in which each cell is a list of the trigger
%       events. The trigger events are labeled by sample number not time. To
%       convert into time, divide the sample numbers by the sample
%       frequency.
%    fs: the sample frequency, in Hz.
%
%    INPUT variables:
%    sqdfile: the MEG file holding the trigger (and MEG) data
%    triggerLinesPotential: a list of which lines should be inspected for
%       triggers. The default is [160:191], i.e. all channels not containing
%       magnetic field data. This function is much more efficient, though, if
%       the triggerLinesPotential is the list of channels actually used as
%       trigger lines. Because of the way the sqd file is read, however, the
%       fastest method is to set triggerLinesPotential to be list of all
%       channels from the lowest used to the highest used.
%    triggerHighThresh (rarely needed): the threshold, in Volts, above
%       which a trigger line goes high. This value is nominally slightly
%       larger than 5 V, so the default value is 5 V.
%    triggerHighThresh (rarely needed): the threshold, in Volts, below
%       which a trigger line is considered to be low. This
%       value is nominally 0 V, so the default value is 0.2 V.
