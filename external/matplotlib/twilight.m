%%% Syntax:
%  map = twilight
%  map = twilight(N)
%
% Colormap designed by Bastian Bechtold.
%
% Cyclic colormaps are designed for plotting data that repeats, therefore the
% colormap loops around (the first and last colors tend to the same color).
% Note that MatPlotLib's TWILIGHT_SHIFTED can be generated very easily:
% map = flipud(circshift(twilight(N),fix(N/2),1));
%
%% Examples %%
%
%%% Plot the scheme's RGB values:
% rgbplot(twilight(256))
%
%%% New colors for the COLORMAP example:
% load spine
% image(X)
% colormap(twilight)
%
%%% New colors for the SURF example:
% [X,Y,Z] = peaks(30);
% surfc(X,Y,Z)
% colormap(twilight)
% axis([-3,3,-3,3,-10,5])
%
%% Input and Output Arguments %%
%
%%% Inputs (*=default):
% N = NumericScalar, N>=0, an integer to define the colormap length.
%   = *[], use the length of the current figure's colormap (see COLORMAP).
%
%%% Outputs:
% map = NumericMatrix, size Nx3, a colormap of RGB values between 0 and 1.
