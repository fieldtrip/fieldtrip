Vgrid version 1.3.1, 2010-05-25

* changed License to GPL

* fixed small problems with mesh.C (HUGE) and materialDB.C (stdlib.h)
	
Vgrid version 1.3

* added support for 3D OpenDX output

* lowered memory consumption
	
Vgrid version 1.2

* fixed bug in marching tets when more than 2 nom-background 
  materials are involved: Spurious cells of the meshed material
  occured outside this material region.

* Added 2D output formats for surface meshes: GMV, OpenDX

* Fixed bug in  gridGenerator::removeNonSurfaceVertices()
  The new vertex graph now contains vertex links, thus 
  enabling smoothing of surface meshes.
