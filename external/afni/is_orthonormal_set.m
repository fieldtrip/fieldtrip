% Orthonormal Sets
% 
% is_orthonormal_set(A) determines if a set of vectors in Euclidean n-space
% is orthonormal. The matrix A is formed from these vectors as its columns. 
% That is, the subspace spanned by the set of vectors is the column space 
% of A. The value 1 is returned if the set is orthonormal. The value 0 is 
% returned if the set is not orthonormal. An error is returned if a set
% containing only zero vectors is attempted to be determined for
% orthonormality.
%
% For example, if the set of row vectors (u1,u2,...} is to be determined 
% for orthonormality, set A to be equal to [u1' u2' ...].
