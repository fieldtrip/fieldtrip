% Bases
% 
% basis_row(A) produces a basis for the subspace of Eucldiean n-space 
% spanned by the vectors {u1,u2,...}, where the matrix A is formed from 
% these vectors as its rows. That is, the subspace is the row space of A. 
% The rows of the matrix that is returned are the basis vectors for the 
% subspace. In general, these basis vectors will not be a subset of the 
% original vectors. An error is returned if a basis for the zero vector 
% space is attempted to be produced.
%
% For example, if the vector space V = span{u1,u2,...}, where u1,u2,... are
% row vectors, then set A to be [u1;u2;...].
%
% For example, if the vector space V = Row(B), where B is an m x n matrix,
% then set A to be equal to B.
