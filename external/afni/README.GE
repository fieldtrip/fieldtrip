This is version 3.1.  This is a minor modification.
Trying to use as many of the spm functions as possible.
Replaced spm_write_vol calls so that the scaling factor is kept at 1.

Questions or comments are welcome.

Generates a mat file to go with every image relating the image coordinates to scanner coordinates.

WARNING - this conversion utility now flips the data to neurological coordinates.

This has been tested with Ax,Sag,Cor with slices acquired SI and IS, LR and RL,
and PA, PA.  Also tested for Oblique axial.
Don't count on double obliques or anything really fancy

The main scripts are GE_convertVolume, GE_convertADW, and GE_dumpHeader.

GE_convertVolume
  Converts a series of 5.X GE slices into Analyze format for SPM.

GE_convertADW
  Converts a series of GE slices acquired on the Advanced Development
Workstation into Analyze format for SPM.  These are 5.X format stored
on the Sun machine GE uses to bypass the 512 images/series limitation
of its database.

GE_dumpHeader
 Dumps much of the header from a GE lx2 or 5.X file to a file or stdout.
