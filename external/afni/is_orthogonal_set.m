% Orthogonal Sets
% 
% is_orthogonal_set(A) determines if a set of vectors in Euclidean n-space 
% is orthogonal. The matrix A is formed from these vectors as its columns. 
% That is, the subspace spanned by the set of vectors is the column space 
% of A. The value 1 is returned if the set is orthogonal. The value 0 is 
% returned if the set is not orthogonal.
%
% For example, if the set of row vectors (u1,u2,...} is to be determined 
% for orthogonality, set A to be equal to [u1' u2' ...].
