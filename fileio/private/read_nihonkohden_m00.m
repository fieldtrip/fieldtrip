function [dat] = read_nihonkohden_m00(filename, begsample, endsample)

% READ_NIHONKOHDEN_M00 reads data Nihon Kohden EEG system and converts the
% floating point ASCII values to 16-bit signed integers from *.m00 file
% format. This function is an adaptation of convert_nkascii2mat.m written
% by Timothy Ellmore
%
% Use as
%   dat = read_nihonkohden_m00(filename)
%
% This returns a header structure with
%   hdr.nSamples      number of data points per channel
%   hdr.nchannels     number of channels sampled during recording
%   hdr.bsweep        begin sweep (ms)
%   hdr.sampintms     sampling interval in ms
%   hdr.binsuV        number of bins per microvolts
%   hdr.start_time    starting time of recording
%   hdr.label         char array of channel names
