function [mvar] = ft_datatype_mvar(mvar, varargin)

% FT_DATATYPE_MVAR describes the FieldTrip MATLAB structure for multi-variate
% autoregressive model data.
%
% The mvar datatype represents multivariate model estimates in the time- or
% in the frequency-domain. This is usually obtained from FT_MVARANALYSIS,
% optionally in combination with FT_FREQANALYSIS.
%
% The following is an example of sensor level MVAR model data in the time
% domain
%        dimord: 'chan_chan_lag'     defines how the numeric data should be interpreted
%         label: {3x1 cell}          the channel labels
%        coeffs: [3x3x5 double]      numeric data (MVAR model coefficients 3 channels x 3 channels x 5 time lags)
%      noisecov: [3x3 double]        more numeric data (covariance matrix of the noise residuals 3 channels x 3 channels)
%           dof: 500
%   fsampleorig: 200
%           cfg: [1x1 struct]
%
% The following is an example of sensor-level MVAR model data in the frequency
% domain
%        dimord: 'chan_chan_freq'    defines how the numeric data should be interpreted
%         label: {3x1 cell}          the channel labels
%          freq: [1x101 double]      the frequencies, expressed in Hz
%      transfer: [3x3x101 double]
%     itransfer: [3x3x101 double]
%      noisecov: [3x3 double]
%     crsspctrm: [3x3x101 double]
%           dof: 500
%           cfg: [1x1 struct]
