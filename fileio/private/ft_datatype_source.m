function [source] = ft_datatype_source(source, varargin)

% FT_DATATYPE_SOURCE describes the FieldTrip MATLAB structure for data that is
% represented at the source level. This is typically obtained with a beamformer of
% minimum-norm source reconstruction using FT_SOURCEANALYSIS.
%
% An example of a source structure obtained after performing DICS (a frequency
% domain beamformer scanning method) is shown here
%
%           pos: [6732x3 double]       positions at which the source activity could have been estimated
%        inside: [6732x1 logical]      boolean vector that indicates at which positions the source activity was estimated
%           dim: [xdim ydim zdim]      if the positions can be described as a 3D regular grid, this contains the
%                                       dimensionality of the 3D volume
%     cumtapcnt: [120x1 double]        information about the number of tapers per original trial
%          time: 0.100                 the latency at which the activity is estimated (in seconds)
%          freq: 30                    the frequency at which the activity is estimated (in Hz)
%           pow: [6732x120 double]     the estimated power at each source position
%     powdimord: 'pos_rpt'             defines how the numeric data has to be interpreted,
%                                       in this case 6732 dipole positions x 120 repetitions (i.e. trials)
%           cfg: [1x1 struct]          the configuration used by the function that generated this data structure
%
% Required fields:
%   - pos
%
% Optional fields:
%   - time, freq, pow, coh, eta, mom, ori, cumtapcnt, dim, transform, inside, cfg, dimord, other fields with a dimord
%
% Deprecated fields:
%   - method, outside
%
% Obsoleted fields:
%   - xgrid, ygrid, zgrid, transform, latency, frequency
%
% Historical fields:
%   - avg, cfg, cumtapcnt, df, dim, freq, frequency, inside, method,
%   outside, pos, time, trial, vol, see bug2513
%
% Revision history:
%
% (2014) The subfields in the avg and trial fields are now present in the
% main structure, e.g. source.avg.pow is now source.pow. Furthermore, the
% inside is always represented as logical vector.
%
% (2011) The source representation should always be irregular, i.e. not
% a 3-D volume, contain a "pos" field and not contain a "transform".
%
% (2010) The source structure should contain a general "dimord" or specific
% dimords for each of the fields. The source reconstruction in the avg and
% trial substructures has been moved to the toplevel.
%
% (2007) The xgrid/ygrid/zgrid fields have been removed, because they are
% redundant.
%
% (2003) The initial version was defined
