function [meg] = read_ctf_meg4(fname, hdr, begsample, endsample, chanindx)

% READ_CTF_MEG4 reads specified samples from a CTF continuous datafile
% It neglects all trial boundaries as if the data was acquired in
% non-continuous mode.
%
% Use as
%   [meg] = read_ctf_meg4(filename, hdr, begsample, endsample, chanindx)
% where
%   filename    name of the datafile, including the .meg4 extension
%   header      with all data information (from read_ctf_meg4)
%   begsample   index of the first sample to read
%   endsample   index of the last sample to read
%   chanindx    index of channels to read (optional, default is all)
%
