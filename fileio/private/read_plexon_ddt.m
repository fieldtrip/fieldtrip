function [dat] = read_plexon_ddt(filename, begsample, endsample)

% READ_PLEXON_DDT reads header or data from a Plexon *.ddt file,
% which is a Plexon continuous data file optimized for continuous
% (streaming) recording where every channel is continuously recorded
% without gaps and the recording includes any dead time between spikes.
% 
% Use as
%   [hdr] = read_plexon_ddt(filename)
%   [dat] = read_plexon_ddt(filename, begsample, endsample)
%
% samples start counting at 1
% returned values are in mV
