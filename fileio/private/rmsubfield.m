function s = rmsubfield(s, f, v)

% RMSUBFIELD removes the contents of the specified field from a structure
% just like the standard Matlab RMFIELD function, except that you can also
% specify nested fields using a '.' in the fieldname. The nesting can be
% arbitrary deep.
%
% Use as
%   s = rmsubfield(s, 'fieldname')
% or as
%   s = rmsubfield(s, 'fieldname.subfieldname')
%
