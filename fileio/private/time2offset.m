function offset = time2offset(time, fsample)

% TIME2OFFSET converts a time-axis of a trial into the offset in samples
% according to the definition from DEFINETRIAL
%
% Use as
%   [offset] = time2offset(time, fsample)
%
% The trialdefinition "trl" is an Nx3 matrix. The first column contains
% the sample-indices of the begin of the trial relative to the begin
% of the raw data , the second column contains the sample_indices of
% the end of the trials, and the third column contains the offset of
% the trigger with respect to the trial. An offset of 0 means that
% the first sample of the trial corresponds to the trigger. A positive
% offset indicates that the first sample is later than the triger, a
% negative offset indicates a trial beginning before the trigger.
