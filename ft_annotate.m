function dataout = ft_annotate(cfg, datain)

% FT_ANNOTATE returns the same output data as the user has provided as input, but allows
% to add comments to that data structure. These comments are stored along with the other
% provenance information and can be displayed with FT_ANALYSISPIPELINE. Adding comments
% is especially useful if you have manually (i.e. in plain MATLAB) modified ythe data
% structure, whereby some provenance information is missing.
%
% Use as
%   outdata = ft_examplefunction(cfg, indata)
% where the input data structure can be any of the FieldTrip data structures and where
% cfg is a configuratioun structure that should contain
%
%  cfg.comment    = string
%
% To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
%   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
%   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
% If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
% file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
% files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
% input/output structure.
