This is the FieldTrip SPIKE toolbox. It contains functions that
complement the FieldTrip toolbox and allow you to do spike and
spike-field analysis, especially aimed at the analysis of animal
electrophysiology data.

The development of this spike toolbox was initiated at the FCDC/DCCN
in Nijmegen by Robert Oostenveld and Thilo Womelsdorf, and subsequently
has been taken over by Martin Vinck at the SILS in Amsterdam.
