function [sts] = ft_spiketriggeredspectrum(cfg, data, spike)

% FT_SPIKETRIGGEREDSPECTRUM computes the Fourier spectrup (amplitude and phase) of
% the LFP around the spikes. A phase of zero corresponds to the spike being on the
% peak of the LFP oscillation. A phase of 180 degree corresponds to the spike being in
% the through of the oscillation. A phase of 45 degrees corresponds to the spike being
% just after the peak in the LFP.
%
% Use as
%   [sts] = ft_spiketriggeredspectrum(cfg, data)
% or
%   [sts] = ft_spiketriggeredspectrum(cfg, data, spike) 
%
% Configurations:
%    cfg.method = 'mtmfft' or 'mtmconvol' (see below)
%
% If you specify the method 'mtmconvol', FT_SPIKETRIGGEREDSPECTRUM_CONVOL is used. If
% you specify 'mtmfft', FT_SPIKETRIGGEREDSPECTRUM_FFT is used (which corresponds to the
% old FT_SPIKETRIGGEREDSPECTRUM).
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% FT_SPIKETRIGGEREDSPECTRUM_FFT determines the spike phases by taking the
% FFT locally around every spike, for one unit. This is an efficient
% algorithm when we have few neurons recorded simultaneously with low
% firing rates. All frequencies are computed using the same time-window.
%
% The function must then be called as
%   [sts] = ft_spiketriggeredspectrum(cfg, data)
% where some channels of DATA are spike channels, and data is in the raw
% format.
%
% For configuration options see FT_SPIKETRIGGEREDSPECTRUM_FFT.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% FT_SPIKETRIGGEREDSPECTRUM_CONVOL computes the Fourier spectrum of the LFP
% around the spikes using convolution of the complete LFP traces. 
% This is a very efficient algorithm if we many spikes per trial. The
% function allows to compute phases for multiple neurons at the same time.
% An additional feature is that every frequency is processed separately (as
% its done through convolution), such that different time-windows can be
% used per frequency.
% Finally, the function can be called by adding a third input (SPIKE) which
% has the same trial definitions as DATA.
%
% The function must then be called as
%   [sts] = ft_spiketriggeredspectrum(cfg, data)
% or
%   [sts] = ft_spiketriggeredspectrum(cfg, data, spike)
% where the spiking information can either be represented  in the first data
% input or in the second spike input structure.
%
% For configurations options see FT_SPIKETRIGGEREDSPECTRUM_CONVOL
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The output STS data structure can be further analyzed using FT_SPIKETRIGGEREDSPECTRUM_STAT
