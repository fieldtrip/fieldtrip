function data = xdf2fieldtrip(filename, varargin)

% XDF2FIELDTRIP reads data from a XDF file with multiple streams. It upsamples the
% data of all streams to the highest sampling rate and concatenates all channels in
% all streams into a raw data structure that is compatible with the output of
% FT_PREPROCESSING.
%
% Use as
%   data = xdf2fieldtrip(filename, ...)
%
% Optional arguments should come in key-value pairs and can include
%   streamindx  = list, indices of the streams to read (default is all)
%
% You can also use the standard procedure with FT_DEFINETRIAL and FT_PREPROCESSING
% for XDF files. This will return (only) the stream with the highest sampling rate,
% which is typically the EEG.
%
% You can use FT_READ_EVENT to read the events from the non-continuous data streams.
% To get them aligned with the samples in one of the specific data streams, you
% should specify the corresponding header structure.
%
% See also FT_PREPROCESSING, FT_DEFINETRIAL, FT_REDEFINETRIAL
