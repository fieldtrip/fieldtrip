function [s, cfg] = ft_statfun_diff(cfg, dat, design)

% FT_STATFUN_DIFF computes the difference of the mean in two conditions.
% Although it can be used for statistical testing, it is not very
% usefull since it will have rather limited sensitivity.
% 
% The purpose of this function is to show you an example on how to
% write a statfun that expresses the difference in the data between
% two conditions. You can use such a function with the statistical
% framework in FieldTrip to perform a simple (or more complex)
% permutation test, without having to worry about the representation
% of the data.
%
% See also FT_STATFUN_MEAN for an other example function
