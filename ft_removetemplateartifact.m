function data = ft_removetemplateartifact(cfg, data, template)

% FT_REMOVETEMPLATEARTIFACT removes an artifact from preprocessed data by template
% subtraction. The template can for example be formed by averaging an ECG triggered
% MEG timecourse.
%
% Use as
%   dataclean = ft_removetemplateartifact(cfg, data, template)
% where data is raw data as obtained from FT_PREPROCESSING and template is a averaged
% timelock structure as obtained from FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS. The configuration should
% be according to
%
%   cfg.channel  = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels (default = 'all'), see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details
%   cfg.artifact = Mx2 matrix with sample numbers of the artifact segments, e.g. obtained from FT_ARTIFACT_EOG
%
% To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
%   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
%   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
% If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
% file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
% files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
% input/output structure.
