#Before running this application:
Please install g.NEEDaccess Server on the Microsoft Windows host PC.

#Command to EXECUTE:
./gtec2ft.exe HostIp HostPort LocalIp LocalPort BufferIP BufferPort

When running this application:
 - use the IP address of the gNEDAccess host PC that runs the server for the 'HostIp'
   command line argument
 - use the port that the gNEDAccess server is listening to from the server's documentation
   for the 'HostPort' command line argument (by default this is 50223)
 - use the IP address of the PC that runs the demo for the 'LocalIp' command
   line argument (do not use the loopback adapter address 127.0.0.1 when server
   and client run at different machines)
 - use an arbitrary free port of the PC that runs the demo for the 'LocalPort'
   command line argument.
 - use the IP address of the computer that is running the FieldTrip buffer server
   for the 'bufferIP' address. When specifying "-", a buffer will be started in
   a separate thread in this application.
 - use the port that the FieldTrip buffer is running on (when remote), or the port
   on which the buffer should be started for the 'BufferPort' command line argument.

The default port for the gNEEDAccess server is 50223, the default port for
the FieldTrip buffer is 1972.

#Example:
./gtec2ft.exe 127.0.0.1 50223 127.0.0.1 2345 192.168.1.100 1972
