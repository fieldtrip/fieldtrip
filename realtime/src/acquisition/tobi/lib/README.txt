tia - contains the compiled libaries for TOBI interface A

ticpp  - http://code.google.com/p/ticpp
  TiCPP is short for the official name TinyXML++. It is a completely
  new interface to TinyXML (http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/)
  that uses MANY of the C++ strengths. Templates, exceptions, and
  much better error handling. It is also fully documented in doxygen.
  It is really cool because this version let's you interface tiny the
  exact same way as before or you can choose to use the new 'ticpp'
  classes. All you need to do is define TIXML_USE_TICPP. It has been
  tested in VC 6.0, VC 7.0, VC 7.1, VC 8.0, MinGW gcc 3.4.5, and in
  Linux GNU gcc 3+.
  
boost - contains information on the boost libraries used.
