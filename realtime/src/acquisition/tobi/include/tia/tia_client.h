/**
* @class TiAClient
* @brief The TiAClient class implements a client for the SignalServer
* The client does not need much of configuration - the only thing that a user has to know is
* the server address and the control connection port of the TOBI SignalServer.
*
* Most of the functions are blocking, which means that the call will not end until
* the function has completed (time consuming) or resulted in an error.
*
* The PIMPL (Pointer to Implementation) idiom is used to achieve binary compatibility.
*
* This class is reentrant but not thread-safe.
*
* Code Example:
*
* @code
*  TiAClient client;
*
*  try
*  {
*    client.connect("127.0.0.1", 9000);
*    client.requestConfig();
*  }
*  catch (std::exception& e)
*  {
*    // error handling
*  }
*
*  SSConfig config = client.config();
*
*  // Read data packet
*  try
*  {
*    DataPacket packet;
*    // Get a packet from the server. Blocks the caller until a packet has been received.
*    client.getDataPacket(packet);
*  }
*  catch (std::exception& e)
*  {
*    // error handling
*  }
*
* @endcode
