*  Definitions concerning the DataPacket have to be done here!
*  This section is especially built for flags, used in the DataPacket.
*  The first 3 bytes are planned to be used for different signal flags,
*  whereby the last flag means an undefined signal type, the 4 bits before
*  "undefined" are user defined signals.
*  The last 6 bits are used for the packet version, if the packet undergoes different adoptions
*  during time.
*  The use of 2 bits is up to now not fixed!
