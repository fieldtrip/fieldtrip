This directory contains FieldTrip buffer data in V1 format.

The numbered subdirectories correspond to a complete cycle of
filling the buffer by first writing the header, and then
writing samples and events. All of these quantities are stored
in the same binary form as in the buffer itself. Additionally,
a plain text file 'header.txt' is written to allow manual inspection.
Finally, the file 'timing' is a plain text file that describes how the
buffer was filled over time. In that file, a line
S 200 0.030
means that 0.03 seconds after writing the header, a block of 200 samples
has been written. Similarly,
E 2 0.124
means that 124ms after writing the header, 2 events were written.
