# Write n=label to select hardware channel number n (starting from 1)
# and attach a label to it. This will show up in the Fieldtrip buffer
# and the GDF file.
# Currently, there is no check for double inclusion of channels.
# That is, if you define 1=FOO and 1=BAR, the first hardware channel
# will show up twice, with different names.
# Channels listed before the first [save] or [stream] line will be added
# to both saving and streaming selections. Write [select] to enable 
# selection for both saving and streaming.
