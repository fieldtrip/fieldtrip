function ft_realtime_pooraudioproxy(cfg)

% FT_REALTIME_POORAUDIOPROXY reads continuous data from the sound card using the
% standard Matlab API and writes it to a FieldTrip buffer. This proxy has poor timing
% and will produce dropped audio frames between blocks. Also the Matlab documentation
% warns about using this API for long recordings because this will fill up memory and
% degrade performance.
%
% The FieldTrip buffer is a network transparent server that allows the acquisition
% client to stream data to it. An analysis client can connect to read the data upon
% request. Multiple clients can connect simultaneously, each analyzing a specific
% aspect of the data concurrently.
%
% Use as
%   ft_realtime_pooraudioproxy(cfg)
%
% The audio-specific configuration structure can contain
%   cfg.channel     = number of channels (1 or 2, default=2)
%   cfg.blocksize   = size of recorded audio blocks in seconds (default=1)
%   cfg.fsample     = audio sampling frequency in Hz (default = 44100)
%   cfg.nbits       = recording depth in bits (default = 16)
%
% Note that currently, the sound will be buffered in double precision irrespective of the sampling bit depth.
%
% The target to write the data to is configured as
%   cfg.target.datafile      = string, target destination for the data (default = 'buffer://localhost:1972')
%   cfg.target.dataformat    = string, default is determined automatic
%
% Finally, there is an option for showing debug output
%   cfg.debug       = show sample time and clock time (default = 'yes')
%
% To stop this realtime function, you have to press Ctrl-C
