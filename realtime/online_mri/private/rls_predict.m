% possible extension:
% also provide predictive variance
% yp +/- sigma*sqrt(1 + x'*model.invX*x)
% sigma would be noise estimate, could be estimated from training data
% and accumulated along with invH and beta. But this only makes sense
% with a forgetting factor (early residuals will be way off).
