function [type] = ft_voltype(vol, desired)

% FT_VOLTYPE determines the type of volume conduction model of the head
%
% Use as
%   [type] = ft_voltype(vol)
% to get a string describing the type, or
%   [flag] = ft_voltype(vol, desired)
% to get a boolean value.
%
% For EEG the following volume conduction models are recognized
%   singlesphere       analytical single sphere model
%   concentricspheres  analytical concentric sphere model with up to 4 spheres
%   halfspace          infinite homogenous medium on one side, vacuum on the other
%   openmeeg           boundary element method, based on the OpenMEEG software
%   bemcp              boundary element method, based on the implementation from Christophe Phillips
%   dipoli             boundary element method, based on the implementation from Thom Oostendorp
%   asa                boundary element method, based on the (commercial) ASA software
%   simbio             finite element method, based on the SimBio software
%   fns                finite difference method, based on the FNS software
%   interpolate        interpolate the potential based on pre-computed leadfields
%
% and for MEG the following volume conduction models are recognized
%   singlesphere       analytical single sphere model
%   localspheres       local spheres model for MEG, one sphere per channel
%   singleshell        realisically shaped single shell approximation, based on the implementation from Guido Nolte
%   infinite           magnetic dipole in an infinite vacuum
%   interpolate        interpolate the potential based on pre-computed leadfields
