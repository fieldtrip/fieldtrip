function [inside] = surface_inside(dippos, pos, tri)

% SURFACE_INSIDE determines if a point is inside/outside a triangle mesh
% whereby the bounding triangle mesh should be closed.
%
% Use as
%   inside = surface_inside(dippos, pos, tri)
% where
%   dippos  position of point of interest (can be 1x3 or Nx3)
%   pos     bounding mesh vertices
%   tri     bounding mesh triangles
