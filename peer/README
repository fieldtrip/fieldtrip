This is the FieldTrip PEER toolbox. It implements peer-to-peer distributed
computing using MATLAB without the need for a centralized server/manager.

The goal of this toolbox is to provide you with an easy MATLAB interface to
distribute your jobs in a way compatible with the MATLAB dfeval, feval and
cellfun functions.

This toolbox has been developed as part of the FieldTrip toolbox, but can be
used separately. See http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org for general details on the
FieldTrip project, http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/peer for specific
details on the peer toolbox or see http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq.
