function [selected] = ft_select_point(pos, varargin)

% FT_SELECT_POINT helper function for selecting a one or multiple points in the
% current figure using the mouse. It returns a list of the [x y] coordinates of the
% selected points.
%
% Use as
%   [selected] = ft_select_point(pos, ...)
%
% Optional input arguments should come in key-value pairs and can include
%   'multiple'   = true/false, make multiple selections, pressing "q" on the keyboard finalizes the selection (default = false)
%   'nearest'    = true/false (default = true)
%
% Example
%   pos = randn(10,2);
%   figure
%   plot(pos(:,1), pos(:,2), '.')
%   ft_select_point(pos)
