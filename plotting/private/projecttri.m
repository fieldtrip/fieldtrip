function [tri] = projecttri(pos, method)

% PROJECTTRI makes a closed triangulation of a list of vertices by
% projecting them onto a unit sphere and subsequently by constructing
% a convex hull triangulation.
%
% Use as
%   [tri] = projecttri(pos, method)
% where method is either 'convhull' (default) or 'delaunay'.
