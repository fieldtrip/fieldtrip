function [filt] = ft_preproc_dftfilter(dat, Fs, Fl, varargin)

% FT_PREPROC_DFTFILTER reduces power line noise (50 or 60Hz) using a 
% discrete Fourier transform (DFT) filter, or spectrum interpolation.
%
% Use as
%   [filt] = ft_preproc_dftfilter(dat, Fsample)
% or 
%   [filt] = ft_preproc_dftfilter(dat, Fsample, Fline)
% or
%   [filt] = ft_preproc_dftfilter(dat, Fsample, Fline, 'dftreplace', 'zero')
% or
%   [filt] = ft_preproc_dftfilter(dat, Fsample, Fline, 'dftreplace', 'neighbour')
% where
%   dat        data matrix (Nchans X Ntime)
%   Fsample    sampling frequency in Hz
%   Fline      frequency of the power line interference (if omitted from the input
%              the default European value of 50 Hz is assumed)
% 
% Additional optional arguments are to be provided as key-value pairs:
%   dftreplace = 'zero' (default), 'neighbour' or 'neighbour_fft'.
% 
% If dftreplace = 'zero', the powerline component's amplitude is estimated by
% fitting a sine and cosine at the specified frequency, and subsequently
% this fitted signal is subtracted from the data. The longer the sharper
% the spectral notch will be that is removed from the data.
% Preferably the data should have a length that is an integer multiple of the
% oscillation period of the line noise (i.e. 20ms for 50Hz noise). If the
% data is of different length, then only the first N complete periods are
% used to estimate the line noise. The estimate is subtracted from the
% complete data.
%
% If dftreplace = 'neighbour' the powerline component is reduced via
% spectrum interpolation (Leske & Dalal, 2019, NeuroImage 189,
% doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.01.026), estimating the required signal
% components by fitting sines and cosines. The algorithmic steps are
% described in more detail below. % Preferably the data should have a length 
% that is an integer multiple of the oscillation period of the line noise
% (i.e. 20ms for 50Hz noise). If the data is of different length, then only
% the first N complete periods are used to estimate the line noise. The 
% estimate is subtracted from the complete data. Due to the possibility of
% using slightly truncated data for the estimation of the necessary signal
% components, this method is more forgiving with respect to numerical
% issues with respect to the sampling frequency, and suboptimal epoch
% lengths, in comparison to the method below.
%
% If dftreplace = 'neighbour_fft' the powerline component is reduced via spectrum 
% interpolation, in its original implementation, based on an algorithm that
% uses an FFT and iFFT for the estimation of the spectral components. The signal is:
% I)   transformed into the frequency domain via a fast Fourier
%       transform (FFT),
% II)  the line noise component (e.g. 50Hz, dftbandwidth = 1 (±1Hz): 49-51Hz) is
%       interpolated in the amplitude spectrum by replacing the amplitude
%       of this frequency bin by the mean of the adjacent frequency bins
%       ('neighbours', e.g. 49Hz and 51Hz).
%       dftneighbourwidth defines frequencies considered for the mean (e.g.
%       dftneighbourwidth = 2 (±2Hz) implies 47-49 Hz and 51-53 Hz).
%       The original phase information of the noise frequency bin is
%       retained.
% III) the signal is transformed back into the time domain via inverse FFT
%       (iFFT).
% If Fline is a vector (e.g. [50 100 150]), harmonics are also considered.
% Preferably the data should be continuous or consist of long data segments
% (several seconds) to avoid edge effects. If the sampling rate and the
% data length are such, that a full cycle of the line noise and the harmonics
% fit in the data and if the line noise is stationary (e.g. no variations
% in amplitude or frequency), then spectrum interpolation can also be
% applied to short trials. But it should be used with caution and checked
% for edge effects.
%
% When using spectral interpolation, additional arguments are:
%
%   dftbandwidth      bandwidth of line noise frequencies, applies to spectrum interpolation, in Hz
%   dftneighbourwidth width of frequencies neighbouring line noise frequencies, applies to spectrum interpolation (dftreplace = 'neighbour'), in Hz
% 
% If the data contains NaNs, the output of the affected channel(s) will be
% all(NaN).
%
% See also PREPROC

% Undocumented option:
%   Fline can be a vector, in which case the regression is done for all
%   frequencies in a single shot. Prerequisite is that the requested
%   frequencies all fit with an integer number of cycles in the data.
