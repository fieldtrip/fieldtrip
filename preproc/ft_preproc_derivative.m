function [dat] = ft_preproc_derivative(dat, order)

% FT_PREPROC_DERIVATIVE computes the temporal Nth order derivative of the
% data
%
% Use as
%   [dat] = ft_preproc_derivative(dat, order)
% where
%   dat        data matrix (Nchans X Ntime)
%   order      number representing the Nth derivative (default = 1)
