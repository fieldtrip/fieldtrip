function [dat, state] = ft_preproc_standardize(dat, begsample, endsample, state)

% FT_PREPROC_STANDARDIZE performs a z-transformation or standardization
% of the data. The standardized data will have a zero-mean and a unit
% standard deviation.
%
% Use as
%   [dat] = ft_preproc_standardize(dat, begsample, endsample)
% where
%   dat        data matrix (Nchans dat Ntime)
%   begsample  index of the begin sample for the mean and stdev estimate
%   endsample  index of the end sample for the mean and stdev estimate
%
% If no begin and end sample are specified, it will be estimated on the
% complete data.
%
% If the data contains NaNs, these are ignored for the computation, but
% retained in the output.
