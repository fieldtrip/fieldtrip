This is the FieldTrip QSUB toolbox. It facilitates distributed computing on
a Linux cluster without requiring the MATLAB parallel toolbox or distributed
computing engines. It only requires a standard MATLAB installation on the
cluster nodes. Alternatively, it can use the MATLAB compiler to run on clusters
where MATLAB is not available or where the number of licenses is limited.

Using the FieldTrip QSUB toolbox requires that you have MATLAB on a computer
from which you can directly (from the Linux command line) submit jobs, and a
shared file system between the submit host and the compute nodes.

The goal of this toolbox is to provide you with an easy MATLAB interface to
distribute your jobs that is compatible with the MATLAB batch, feval and
cellfun functions. It offers a simple MATLAB interface to distribute your jobs
and you do not have to go to the Linux command-line to use the qsub command
from there.  The toolbox supports Linux clusters with Torque and other PBS
versions, Sun Grid Engine (SGE), Oracle Grid Engine and with SLURM as the
batch queueing system.

This toolbox has been developed as part of the FieldTrip toolbox, but can be
used separately. See http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org for general details on the
FieldTrip project, http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/qsub for specific
details on the qsub toolbox or see http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq.
