FieldTrip is the MATLAB software toolbox for MEG and EEG analysis that is being
developed at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour in Nijmegen,
the Netherlands together with collaborating institutes.

The toolbox offers advanced analysis methods of MEG, EEG, and invasive
electrophysiological data, such as time-frequency analysis, source reconstruction
using dipoles, distributed sources and beamformers and non-parametric statistical
testing. It supports the data formats of all major MEG systems (CTF,
Neuromag/Elekta/Megin, BTi/4D, Yokogawa/Ricoh) and of most popular EEG systems, and
new formats can be added easily. FieldTrip contains high-level functions that you
can use to construct your own analysis protocols in MATLAB. Furthermore, it easily
allows methods researchers to incorporate new methods for EEG/MEG analysis.
